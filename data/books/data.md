“...What’re you doing?”
The first time Amane Fujimiya spoke to Mahiru Shiina was when he
caught sight of her sitting on a swing in the park, in the middle of the
pouring rain.
This was Amane’s first year as a high school student. He’d recently
begun living alone in a nearby apartment building. Little did he know when
he first moved in that his next-door neighbor was a veritable angel on Earth.
Of course, calling her an angel was just a figure of speech, but Mahiru
Shiina was such a beautiful, sweet girl that the comparison seemed entirely
fitting.
Her straight, well-groomed, flaxen hair was always silky smooth and
lustrous. The girl’s pale, milky-white skin was always soft, as if it had never
been anything less than perfect. From her shapely nose and large eyes
rimmed with long eyelashes to her delicate, dewy pink lips, every part of
her looked like it had been sculpted by the practiced hand of a true master.
Amane went to the same high school as Mahiru and was in the same
grade, so he’d heard plenty about her. Mostly, people talked about her
beauty or how she was accomplished in both academics and sports.
As it happened, Mahiru always got the top score on exams and was a
real ace in gym class, too. Amane was in a different class, so he didn’t
know all the details, but if the rumors were anything to judge by, Mahiru
was some kind of superhuman being.
Truly, she seemed without a flaw—attractive in face and figure and an
excellent student. Perhaps most surprising was that she wasn’t the least bit


stuck-up about it. With her quiet, modest personality, it was no wonder she
was so popular.
Living next door to such a beautiful girl would’ve gotten most boys
practically salivating at the mere thought. Amane, however, didn’t intend to
make a fuss over her or try to get too close.
He certainly wouldn’t deny that Mahiru Shiina was beautiful, but she
had never been more than a neighbor to him. There hadn’t really been any
opportunities for them to talk, and not once did he consider approaching her
himself.
If they did somehow become involved in some fashion, it would
definitely make a lot of other boys jealous, and that’d be trouble. Amane
knew it was better to remain amicable next-door neighbors and avoid the
wrath of her other admirers.
It was possible to appreciate a charming girl without falling in love with
her, after all. Amane recognized that Mahiru was the kind of girl best
cherished from afar and had contented himself with existing in her life as
only her neighbor.
Thus, when Amane caught sight of her looking lost in thought and alone
in the pouring rain without an umbrella, he couldn’t help but stop and stare,
wondering what she might be doing.
The downpour was heavy enough to send most everyone else scurrying
home, but there she was, sitting all by herself on a swing in the park
between their school and their apartment building.
_What is she doing in the rain?_ Amane wondered.
Everything was gloomy beneath the darkened sky, and the rain,
relentless since that morning, only made it even more difficult to see.
Mahiru’s conspicuous flaxen hair and her school uniform made it
impossible to miss her, however, even veiled by the dismal weather.
Amane did not know why she was sitting there without an umbrella,
letting herself get soaked. Mahiru didn’t appear to be waiting for someone,
nor did she seem at all concerned by the rain. As far as Amane could tell,
Mahiru was simply staring off into the distance.
Her face was tilted slightly upward, and though she was always pale, her
complexion appeared downright pallid. If she wasn’t careful, she was sure
to catch a cold, but even so, Mahiru sat there quietly, not making any move
to head home.


_If she’s content to sit there, it probably isn’t my place to interfere_ , Amane
thought as he made his way quickly past the park. He took one last look and
could see that Mahiru’s face was screwed up as if she might cry.
Amane scratched his head nervously. He wasn’t really looking to make
any kind of connection with her or anything, but it seemed wrong to him to
ignore another person who was making such a pained expression.
“...What’re you doing?”
When he called out to her in the bluntest voice possible, trying to
convey that he was not a threat, she tossed her long hair, now heavy with
water, and looked at him.
Mahiru’s face was as lovely as ever.
Even wet with rain, its radiance was not dulled. In fact, every droplet
only seemed to enhance her elegant features. One could say she was
dripping with beauty.
She stared at him with large, striking eyes.
Mahiru must have been vaguely aware of Amane as her next-door
neighbor because they occasionally passed each other in the morning.
However, the look in her caramel-colored eyes revealed that she was
slightly guarded—someone she had never really spoken with had suddenly
called out to her.
“Fujimiya? May I help you?”
Amane was rather shocked that Mahiru had remembered his name, but
at the same time, he also figured that this level of familiarity most likely
wouldn’t cause her to drop her guard. It was only to be expected that
Mahiru would raise her defenses when confronted by a stranger, even if he
wasn’t entirely unknown.
She probably didn’t want much to do with the opposite sex. It certainly
seemed like she received plenty of romantic advances from the boys at
school, regardless of what year they were in. Would anyone have blamed
Mahiru for suspecting Amane of harboring an ulterior motive?
“I don’t really need anything. I was just wondering why you were sitting
in a place like this, all alone in the rain.”
“Oh, you were? I’m grateful for your concern, but I’m here simply
because I want to be. Don’t worry about me.”
There was no edge of suspicion in Mahiru’s soft, listless voice, but it
was also clear that she had no intention of opening up to Amane.


_All right, suit yourself._
It was clear that there was something going on with her, but she didn’t
seem to want Amane to get involved, and he wasn’t particularly inclined to
pursue the matter any further.
Amane had only approached her on a whim. He’d simply been curious
about her situation; that was all. It wasn’t really his concern. If this was
what she wanted to be doing, then that was just fine by him.
Amane sensed the evanescent beauty regarding him with some
suspicion. He was sure that Mahiru was wondering why he’d even bothered
speaking to her at all.



“Ah, I see,” he offered in reply.
Pressing the issue wouldn’t get him anywhere, so Amane decided to
withdraw. There was no shared history between them, and perhaps that was
for the best. The decision to leave her alone was an easy one.
Even with a very good reason to depart, Amane still didn’t think it
seemed right to abandon her—and thoroughly soaked to boot.
“You’ll catch a cold, so take this and go home. No need to bother giving
it back.”
Deciding this would be the one and only time he meddled, Amane
offered Mahiru his own umbrella. After all, he didn’t want her to get sick or
anything.
Amane handed over the umbrella—or to put it more accurately, he gave
her little choice but to accept. Without giving Mahiru a chance to reply, he
turned away and took off. As he left the scene, Amane heard Mahiru calling
to him.
Whatever she was trying to say was too quiet and became drowned out
by the rain. Amane didn’t stop or turn around until the park was well behind
him.
He had cared enough about the girl possibly catching a cold to foist his
umbrella on her, so he didn’t feel that guilty about the fact that he had
originally intended to ignore her altogether.
At any rate, Mahiru had refused his attempt to start a conversation, and
Amane didn’t intend to get any closer to her, either. After all, they had no
connection to each other beyond this.
Amane assured himself along those lines as he made his way home.


“Amane, your sniffling’s annoying.”
“ _You’re_ annoying.”
The next day, it was Amane who’d ended up with the cold.
As his classmate and good friend Itsuki Akazawa had pointed out,
Amane had been trying and failing to snort everything back up his nose.
Trying to exhale only resulted in a terrible, wet, burbling sound.
Amane wasn’t sure whether it was because his nose was stuffed up or as
a result of the cold itself, but a throbbing pain was spreading across the
back of his head. He had taken some over-the-counter medicine, but it
wasn’t making a dent in his symptoms at all. Truly, Amane was a sad sight.
His congested face twisted in nasal distress as he became well acquainted
with a tissue.
Itsuki looked at him, not with concern but exasperation.
“You were just fine yesterday, dude.”
“I got caught in the rain.”
“Aw, chin up. Wait, didn’t you have an umbrella yesterday?”
“...I gave it to someone.”
Naturally, there was no way that Amane could openly admit at school
that he’d given it to Mahiru, so he kept things vague.
Incidentally, he’d caught a glimpse of Mahiru earlier that day. She’d
looked rather well, not ill at all. Amane couldn’t help but laugh. Things had
gotten completely flipped around. It was his own fault—he’d neglected to
warm up in the bath when he’d gotten home.


“Don’cha think you were being a little too nice, lending out your
umbrella when it was pouring like that?”
“Not really. Even if I did, no point complaining about it now.”
“And who did you give it to anyway? Who was worth catching a cold?”
“...A, uh, a lost little kid?”
_Can’t really call her a kid with that body, though... Well, that and the
fact that we’re the same age. Although, her face did look kinda lost..._
Something clicked when Amane thought of the unusual encounter that
way. Her expression had been exactly that of a lost little kid searching for
their parent.
“Well, what a kind and upstanding gentleman you are!” Itsuki laughed,
unaware of the feelings bubbling up in Amane’s chest as he recalled his
meeting with Mahiru the day before. “But you know, even if you let
someone borrow your umbrella or whatever, I bet your real problem was
that you got lazy and didn’t warm up afterward. That’s why you’re dying.”
“...How do you know that?” Amane shot back.
“Well, you don’t exactly take good care of yourself. That much was
obvious the moment I saw your place. That’s why you got sick, dumbass.”
Amane couldn’t really argue with Itsuki’s friendly ribbing. It was true
that he didn’t have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad
at keeping things tidy, and his room was always a total mess. What’s more,
he subsisted on a diet of convenience-store meals and nutritional
supplements. The only time he had a decent meal was when he went out to
eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated with him, asking him
how he could live like that.
Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that
Amane had caught a cold overnight.
“You oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow’s Saturday,
so focus on getting better,” Itsuki advised.
“I will...,” Amane replied.
“If only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do.”
Itsuki’s lips curled up at his slight boast.
“Shut up. I don’t need to hear that from a guy who’s already got a
girlfriend.” Amane slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the
back of his hand, intensely irritated.


As the day wore on, Amane’s condition continued to deteriorate.
The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain
and a fatigue that permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried
home after school, his body seemed to be losing its battle against the
disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow.
Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced
his heavy legs to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the
wall. His breathing was rougher than usual, and he felt hot.
Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but
he’d let his guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had
suddenly taken a turn for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of
riding in the elevator, normally not a concern, was now a source of dull
agony.
When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane’s floor, he staggered
out on leaden feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost
immediately, he was confronted by a sight that caused him to seize up,
however.
Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to
again, her shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features
were full of life, her complexion vibrant and glowing.
Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to
catch a cold, she was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were
on vivid display.
In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced
on her the day before, neatly folded and closed.
_She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn’t have
to_ , Amane reasoned.
“...Really, you don’t need to give it back,” he said aloud.
“It’s only natural to return something you borrowed...” Mahiru hesitated
as soon as she got a good look at Amane’s face. “Um. You have a fever,
don’t you...?”
“...It’s got nothing to do with you.”
Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into
Mahiru—and all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that
shouldn’t have been worth the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart,
however, and was sure to quickly figure out how Amane had caught a cold.


“But you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella...”
“That’s totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim.”
“It most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I
was out there in the rain.”
“I said it’s fine, really. It’s not something you need to worry about.”
From Amane’s perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self-
satisfaction, and he didn’t want her fussing over him now.
However, Mahiru didn’t seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was
written across her graceful features.
“...So yeah, it’s all good. See ya.” Their back-and-forth was quickly
growing taxing, so Amane decided to force his way out from under
Mahiru’s questioning and concern.
Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled
his keys out of his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately,
Amane fumbled quite a bit as he opened the door to his apartment. The
moment he got it open, all the strength left his body.
Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame
for how his body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him.
Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid
enough that it wouldn’t break, and he wouldn’t fall. Surely it would catch
him, and he’d be fine.
_The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there’s no avoiding it..._ ,
Amane thought, resigning himself to the pain.
However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back
upright.
“...Just as I thought; I can’t leave you alone like this.” Amane heard a
fragile voice through his feverish haze. “I’ll repay your favor.”
Amane’s head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he
quickly gave up. Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had
propped up his limp body and opened the door to his apartment.
“I’m going to help you inside. There’s no other way, so please forgive
the intrusion.”
Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument.
The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled
along, entering his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his
life. It was true that he didn’t have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health,


but it seemed that an angel had descended to care for him instead.

Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state
of his place until it was too late. It wasn’t until he saw the condition his
home was in that he regretted ever letting Mahiru enter.
His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the
bedroom and main living space.
It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but
Amane’s parents were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after
considering the safety of the neighborhood and the convenience of nearby
transportation. Amane had always thought that spending so much money on
housing was unnecessary. The apartment was much too large for a single
person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he wasn’t about to
complain.
Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage
boy. Things were not kept especially tidy. Various items were scattered all
over the living room, and needless to say, there was the state of the
bedroom.
“This is too pitiful to look at.” The angel, Amane’s savior, gave him a
frank assessment of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the
contrast to her charming appearance.
Amane could hardly argue—it really was a sorry sight. If he’d known
that he’d be bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some
things, perhaps tidied up a bit, but it was too late for that now.
Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to
moving Amane into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and
Amane vowed to do some serious cleaning sometime soon.
“First, I’m going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change
clothes before I get back. You can do that, right?” Mahiru asked.
“...You’re coming back?”
“My conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even
to sleep,” Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now
that Amane had felt toward her when she was soaking wet the day before.
Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he
obediently did as he was told and started changing out of his school


uniform.
“It’s really a mess in here; there’s nowhere to even step... How can
anyone live like this...?”
As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming
from the next room, and felt quite ashamed.
After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep
without realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids
again, flaxen hair was the first thing he saw.
Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at
his side, peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a
dream.
“...What time is it?” Amane asked, confused.
“Seven in the evening,” Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. “You slept
for several hours.”
As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink
that she had poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to
his lips, then finally was able to take a look at his surroundings.
Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than
before.
He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead.
When he did, his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth.
There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn’t have
any of those at his place, and he looked up at Mahiru.
“I brought it from home,” she answered immediately.
Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment—and no sports drinks,
either. Mahiru must have brought that over as well.
“...Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble.”
“It’s fine.”
There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru’s curt
answer.
Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It
definitely didn’t mean that she genuinely wanted to spend time with
Amane. He was sure of that. She was already talking with a boy she barely
knew—and alone in his apartment no less. That she would make sure there
were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only natural.
“For the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your


desk. It’s better to take it with something in your stomach... Are you
hungry at all?” Mahiru asked gently.
“Mm, a little bit,” Amane answered.
“Oh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you’re
welcome to have some.”
“...Huh, you made it yourself?”
“Is there anyone else here but me? If you don’t want it, I’ll eat it all
alone.”
“No, I’ll eat it! Please let me eat it!”
Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for
him. For a moment, he was caught off guard.
Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but
he’d never heard rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly
confident it wouldn’t be awful.
Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane’s sudden bow and
insistence that he would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the
thermometer that was sitting on the side table.
“I’ll bring it to you, so take your temperature first.”
“Okay,” Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began
unbuttoning his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away.
“Do it after I leave the room, please.” There was a slight rise in her
voice, and Amane spied that the girl’s pale cheeks were tinged red.
Amane hadn’t thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He
didn’t consider it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered.
Perhaps she wasn’t accustomed to seeing much skin.
Mahiru’s alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing
face turned away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be
changing hue, making her shyness almost palpable.
_...Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always
saying how cute she is._
Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he’d also
never had any special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation
for her gentle beauty. He had looked at her like something akin to a work of
art and had been content to admire her like one would a distant masterpiece.
Mahiru wasn’t some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his
apartment, looking slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane


saw her as a girl and not some idol, and it was strangely adorable.
The two didn’t have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up
and say that he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably
just come across as weird if he tried, which was why he kept his
impressions to himself.
“...Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?” he
asked.
“Y-you don’t have to tell me,” Mahiru answered dismissively. “I’ll be
right back.” She turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away.
It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or
maybe because of all the clutter. Probably the latter.
After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had
turned out this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh.



_...Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened._
Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his
apartment. It was too dangerous; she could be attacked or something.
Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must’ve meant she was worried
about him. Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either
way, Amane didn’t think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only
helping him out of a sense of obligation.
Amane’s mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as
he waited. Then came a hesitant knock at the door.
“...I’ve brought the porridge.”
At the sound of Mahiru’s concerned voice from the next room, Amane
remembered again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his
temperature.
“I haven’t taken my temperature yet,” he called back.
“I thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though...”
“Sorry, I spaced out.”
Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit.
After a few moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked
it out and held it up to look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3
degrees Celsius. It wasn’t bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still
pretty high.
“Okay, I’m finished,” Amane said as he put his shirt back on.
Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded
bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed
his clothes.
“What was your temperature?” she asked.
“Thirty-eight point three. I’ll be better after I take some medicine and
get some more sleep.”
“...Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won’t
eliminate the virus itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your
immune system do its job.”
Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern,
embarrassed Amane.
Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side
table, then opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It
looked severely watered down—maybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent


water. Perhaps Mahiru had done that intentionally because she’d thought
it’d be easier on Amane’s stomach. She’d likely added the plums because of
their reputation as being good for fighting colds.
The dish wasn’t steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane
guessed that Mahiru hadn’t brought it straight from the stove but had
instead made sure to let it to cool down first.
Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a
smaller bowl with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit
up a bit for him and had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of
the plums and the white of the rice mixed easily.
“Here you go. It shouldn’t be too hot.”
“Mm, thank you.”
Mahiru gave Amane a puzzled look as he received the bowl, but then he
merely stared at the porridge while his spoon hovered over it.
“...What is it; you want me to feed you? Sorry, but that’s not on the
menu,” Mahiru asserted.
“Nobody asked for that, okay? It’s just... So I guess you can cook, too,
huh?” Amane asked.
“I live alone, so of course I can.” The girl’s words stung, a heavy
reminder of Amane’s own domestic failures. “But before you learn to cook,
you should learn to clean up your room, Fujimiya.”
“Yes, ma’am...”
Mahiru had quickly and thoroughly put him in his place. Amane
grumbled quietly and scooped up some of the porridge, stuffing the spoon
into his mouth in a bid to end the conversation.
The flavor of the lightly salted rice spread across his tongue as he ate the
porridge. The mellow sourness of the pickled plums pulled it all together. It
was truly a dish with a perfect balance of flavors.
Amane didn’t like pickled plums that were too salty, but these had a
milder taste and a bit of sweetness. They were actually a favorite of his.
Often, he liked to top green tea rice with pickled plums.
“It’s good.”
“Thanks for saying so. Though, really, once you’ve tasted one rice
porridge, I think you’ve probably tasted them all.” Mahiru’s answer
appeared indifferent, save for the very slightest beginnings of a smile.
Without meaning to, Amane found himself staring at the beautiful girl’s


relieved expression. Something about it seemed quite different from the
more outgoing smile he occasionally caught her wearing at school.
“...Fujimiya?” Mahiru asked.
“Sorry, it’s nothing,” he answered.
Amane thought it a shame that such a beautiful smile had been so
fleeting, though he kept the musing to himself. Instead, he shoveled
spoonful after spoonful of porridge into his mouth.

“...Anyhow, you rest today. And make sure to replenish your fluids. If you
need to wipe away sweat, use this. I’ve put water into your washbowl, so
make sure to wet it and wring it out before wiping, okay?”
After Amane had eaten, Mahiru diligently prepared an unopened sports
drink, readied the bowl of water, and laid out a towel and spare cooling
sheets. All had been carefully placed on the side table in Amane’s bedroom.
There was no way Mahiru was going to stay over at the home of a boy
she barely knew. Amane wouldn’t have stood for it if she’d tried. Thus,
Mahiru had prepared everything Amane could’ve needed while he rested,
and he was grateful for her diligence, though he stared at her the whole time
she got everything ready.
_This is an awful lot just to repay a favor. Once this is over, I guess we
won’t have much reason to interact. It’s a one-off thing, a freak occurrence;
that’s all.
Well, since we won’t be talking ever again, I guess it’s all right to ask
about that thing I want to know._
Whether from the medicine or his nap, Amane’s head felt clearer, though
he was still exhausted.
“Hey, there’s something I’ve been wondering...,” he started.
“What is it?” Mahiru turned to look at him from where she was setting
up all the essentials he’d need.
“Why were you sitting out in the rain? Did you have a fight with your
boyfriend or something?” The strange behavior that’d kicked off this whole
chain of events had been on Amane’s mind since he’d first noticed it.
Mahiru had been rocking back and forth on a swing in the pouring rain.
What could she have been doing there?
It was precisely because Amane had been curious about Mahiru’s slight


resemblance to a lost child that he’d offered her his umbrella in the first
place. He’d never discovered why she’d been out there in the storm to begin
with, however.
Amane had thought Mahiru had been waiting for someone, so he’d
guessed that there was a boy she was dating, even wondering if perhaps she
and her boyfriend had gotten into an argument. In response to Amane’s
question, Mahiru looked at him as if she was fed up.
“Sorry, but I don’t have a boyfriend, and I have no plans to get one,” she
replied.
“Huh? Why?” Amane asked almost unconsciously.
“Let me ask you, why did you assume I was dating someone?”
“With how popular you are, I thought you’d have at least one or two
boyfriends.”
Something about this back-and-forth made Mahiru seem much more like
a normal girl to Amane. She was kind but strong-willed. To other people,
though, he was sure she seemed quite different. Mahiru was a beautiful girl
who was tidy, sweet, quiet, and humble. Her pretty face, so lovely that she
was often called an angel, turned heads wherever she went, and her body
was petite but possessed abundant curves. The briefest sight of her instilled
a strange, momentary feeling of wanting to protect her. That quality,
combined with her excellent sense of style, made her an object of desire for
many a schoolboy.
On top of all that, her grades kept her at the top of her class, and she was
an all-around excellent athlete. What’s more, Amane had just learned
firsthand that she was good at cooking, too. That certainly wouldn’t hurt her
popularity.
Just one glance was enough to know there must have been plenty of
guys who were after her, and Amane knew for a fact that quite a few of his
own classmates had romantic feelings for Mahiru. She could’ve had her
pick of the litter, and it hadn’t occurred to him that she might not be seeing
anyone.
That was what Amane had meant when he’d said that thing about one or
two boyfriends, but the moment she’d heard those words, Mahiru’s
expression had stiffened, if only for a moment.
“I don’t have a boyfriend, and what’s more, I’m not the kind of girl who
would keep the company of several boys at once. It’s absolutely out of the


question.”
Mahiru’s eyes were so cold, they sent a shiver down Amane’s spine. He
realized immediately that he’d stepped on some kind of social land mine.
It might have been because of his sickness, but he felt a chill pass over
him, and the room seemed drafty all of a sudden.
“Sorry, that’s not what I meant. I apologize,” Amane said.
“...No, I’m sorry for getting fired up.”
Mahiru bowing her head seemed to disperse the cold, tense atmosphere
of the room. More than being “fired up,” Mahiru’s icy reply to Amane’s
question had been like a blizzard, though he knew better than to point that
out.
“Anyway, that’s not what was going on at all. I was just trying to cool
my head a bit... And I really am sorry that you caught a cold because you
were worried about me,” Mahiru explained.
“It’s fine. I mean, it was my decision, after all. I feel kind of guilty about
all this, actually. I only gave you the umbrella as a spur-of-the-moment kind
of thing. I’ll try not to bother you once this is all over.”
Amane was sure that Mahiru was only there to help out of some sense of
obligation, but when she heard what he had to say, she blinked a few times
and gave him a curious look. It must have intrigued her to hear that he
wouldn’t be troubling her again.
“We don’t really have any reason to interact, so it’s not like it’ll be a big
deal. I mean, even if you’re the most beautiful girl in our grade, and a
genius, and everyone calls you an angel, I wasn’t trying to hook up with
you; I swear. You don’t think that this was some kind of scheme or
something, do you?” Amane inquired.
Mahiru looked away a little awkwardly. A bitter smile spread across her
lips, as if she’d been waiting for Amane to say those exact words. Finally,
he realized that she wasn’t just acting cagey. Mahiru had probably wound
up in that sort of situation a few times before. A guy trying to get in with a
beautiful girl by making her feel indebted was, unfortunately, not unheard
of.
It explained why Mahiru had been so wary of Amane that day in the
rain. She hadn’t been upset at him; she’d just been trying to protect herself.
“It must be so irritating. Being bothered by guys you don’t even like,”
Amane said.


“Well, that’s true, but...” Mahiru’s voice trailed off.
“Called it,” quipped Amane, a little surprised to hear her admit it.
_So the quiet, charming, model student, the one everybody makes a big
fuss over, the one everybody calls an angel, does have things she doesn’t
like. Why, she even gets annoyed from time to time, just like the rest of us
mortals._ The thought gave Amane the sudden impression that he was seeing
the real Mahiru for the first time.
Unfortunately, the way she glared back at Amane seemed to suggest that
she was really regretting having ever met him. It looked like she resented
him for making her reveal how she really felt.
_Further proof that the angelic honor student has real emotions hidden
deep down_ , Amane thought.
“I don’t really see the problem with that,” admitted Amane. “Actually,
I’m relieved. It’s nice to hear that the angel finds that stuff just as annoying
as normal humans.”
“...Please stop calling me that.” Mahiru obviously hated the title others
had given her. With disapproval in her eyes, she continued to gaze at
Amane.
Even her displeasure seemed interesting to Amane, who smiled again
and said, “Not to worry, I won’t bother you again without a good reason.”
Mahiru’s eyes opened wide as if his declaration had caught her by
surprise. With the faintest whisper of a smile crossing her lips, she bowed
sharply and left.

Amane lay in bed, staring vacantly up at the ceiling while thinking about
Mahiru.
Even though the medicine had taken effect, he was, unsurprisingly, still
feeling sluggish. If he relaxed, sleep would surely claim him in no time at
all. He closed his eyes and reflected on the events of the day.
No one would ever believe him if he told them that he’d been nursed
back to health by an angel with a surprisingly sharp tongue. The day’s
events were a secret shared only by Amane and Mahiru.
_It feels kinda weird to call it a secret. It’s more like it’d be a real pain to
explain the whole story. It’s just easier not to tell anybody, that’s all_ , Amane
reasoned.


As he slowly lost consciousness, Amane told himself that, when
tomorrow came, he and Mahiru would be nothing more than mere
acquaintances again.


As Amane had anticipated, he and Mahiru had returned to being nothing
more than two people who attended the same school.
He’d been feeling much better the following day and had happened to
run into Mahiru when he went out to shop at the convenience store, but they
hadn’t said very much to each other. Amane did catch that Mahiru looked a
little relieved to see him well on his way to recovery.
Nothing changed back at school on the following Monday, either. The
two were back to being strangers. The only tiny difference was that now,
whenever they encountered each other on the way to school, she would
greet him with a quick bow. That was all.
“Oh, Amane, you feeling better?”
“I’m good, thanks.”
It seemed that Itsuki had also been worried about Amane. He’d been in
rather bad shape last Friday, after all. Amane’s condition had been the first
thing Itsuki asked about when they saw each other outside the school
building. Itsuki had even sent Amane a text over the weekend: _“You’re not
dead, right?”_
Amane had sent back a message that he was fine, but it seemed Itsuki
had only been half-convinced, because he let out a deep sigh of relief when
he saw in person how much better his friend was feeling.
“Yeah, well, when I saw you in such bad shape, even I started to worry,
man! It’s all good if you’re better now. You oughtta take better care of
yourself. Start by cleaning your room or somethin’.”
“You sound like somebody else I know,” Amane quipped.


“Huh?”
“Nothing. Something happened this weekend that kind of opened my
eyes. I’ll clean my place up in a few days.”
Itsuki didn’t let up. “Nah, man, you gotta sort yourself out _now_ !”
Amane turned away in a huff. It would probably take more than half a
day to clean that mess up.
Looking exasperated, Itsuki backed off a bit, saying, “I mean, you can
live however you want, ya know. But just clear a path you can actually walk
through for the next time I come over.”
“...I’ll deal with it.”
Wearing a sour face the whole time, Amane changed into his indoor
shoes and headed for his classroom. An extremely boisterous room caught
his attention as he walked down a hall, however, and he couldn’t help but
peek in.
Glancing in through a hallway window, Amane saw Mahiru, as beautiful
as she’d ever been, surrounded by her classmates.
Whenever someone spoke to her, she would turn to them with a quiet
smile. Everything about her persona seemed totally different from the
Mahiru he’d seen the other day. Amane suddenly broke out in a smile.
Noticing his friend’s gaze, Itsuki’s eyes followed the same path. He saw
Mahiru and immediately understood.
“Shiina, huh? As popular as always. No surprise, given how pretty she
is.”
“Well, you know what they say. She’s an angel. What about you, Itsuki?
Think she’s cute?” Amane asked.
“Yeah, I guess so. But I’ve got Chi, so only in a sorta aesthetic-
appreciation-type way,” Itsuki replied.
“Quit going on about your girlfriend already.”
Itsuki had a girlfriend named Chi, although that was a nickname. Her
full name was Chitose Shirakawa.
They were an extremely close couple, madly in love with each other—it
gave Amane heartburn whenever he saw them together.
Although Amane was quick to dismiss the girlfriend talk, Itsuki didn’t
seem particularly offended. Amane often said things like that, so Itsuki just
laughed. “You’re heartless. So lemme ask you: Do you think she’s cute,
Amane?”


“She’s definitely beautiful, but that’s all,” answered Amane.
“How bland,” Itsuki commented.
“She’s like a flower on a high peak that my hand could never reach. I’ve
got nothing to do with her. Looking is enough.”
“Fair.”
Some quirk of fate may have brought Mahiru and Amane together that
other day, but they were truly destined to live in different worlds.
The idea that Amane, a self-admitted hopeless loser, and Mahiru, the
beautiful super-student who could do anything, might one day have any
kind of relationship, let alone a romantic one, was frankly ridiculous. It was
a veritable impossibility.
_That’s right_ , Amane thought. _There’s no need to concern myself with her
any further._

“...What are you eating?”
The theory that the two would never interact again was quickly
disproven. Amane was sucking down some nutritional jelly on his veranda
while gazing up at the sky when Mahiru called to him.
It’d been too much of a bother to even go to the convenience store, so he
was contenting himself with the pouch of jelly he had at home while getting
some air when Mahiru unexpectedly came out onto her own veranda.
She leaned over her railing slightly, looked at the nutritional jelly pouch
that was in Amane’s mouth, and frowned.
For a moment, Amane was frozen; he’d thought she was done with him.
“Can’t you see? It’s a ten-second energy-replenishment jelly,” he finally
answered.
“...Don’t tell me that’s what you’re calling dinner?” Mahiru asked,
incredulous.
“Of course it is.”
“That’s all you’re eating? A high school boy, with a healthy appetite?”
“That’s none of your business.”
Normally, Amane would’ve eaten a boxed meal from the convenience
store or something premade from the supermarket, but today, he’d
neglected to pick something up for dinner, and he didn’t feel like instant
ramen, so this was all he had. It probably wouldn’t be enough, though, so he


planned on having a snack later, too.
“...I guess I don’t need to ask whether you can cook for yourself. It
definitely doesn’t seem like you can, at least. And yet you’re living on your
own, even though you can’t cook or clean...” Mahiru’s observation was
brutally honest.
“Shut up. That’s none of your business,” Amane fired back, though he
knew he couldn’t argue with the truth. He frowned and finished off the
remainder of his jelly.
He’d wised up about cleaning his place a couple days ago and was
definitely planning to do something about it sometime soon. Ruminating on
Mahiru’s scolding only seemed to make Amane want to do it less, however.
It also made him wonder why she was making such a fuss over him in the
first place.
Mahiru just stared at Amane, then let out a soft sigh. “...Wait here,” she
instructed before disappearing back into her own apartment.
“What now?” Amane grumbled as he listened to the clatter of the glass
door closing behind her.
He’d been told to wait, but he didn’t know what for. Turning a puzzled
gaze toward Mahiru’s apartment, Amane stood there obediently, but there
was no immediate answer.
_It’s starting to get chilly out here; I’d like to go inside, but..._
He’d been told to stay put, so that was what he’d do. The autumn
evening was colder than expected, and Amane’s loosely fitting, casual
clothes did little to help him stay warm.
As Amane waited, watching his deep breaths come out white in the cold,
he heard the electronic bell chime from his front door, announcing a visitor.
It was pretty obvious who it was.
Truly puzzled, Amane made his way toward the front door, dodging
scattered clothes and magazines on the floor.
He knew who it was without even looking through the peephole, so he
slid his feet into a pair of slippers, took the chain off the door, and opened
it. As expected, he came face-to-face with waves of sandy-blond hair.
“...What are you doing?” Amane asked.
“I couldn’t stand how badly you were neglecting your health. These are
just some leftovers I had, but please take them,” Mahiru stated plainly as
she abruptly stuck a hand out in front of her. In her delicate palm, somewhat


smaller than Amane’s own, was a plastic container. He could vaguely see
some sort of stewed dish through the semi-transparent lid. He couldn’t tell
exactly what it was, however, as the container had filled with steam from
the warmth of the food.
Mahiru seemed to understand the confused look in Amane’s eyes as he
stood there blinking. She let out a deep sigh. “You’re not eating properly.
Nutritional supplements are just that—supplements. You can’t live on them
alone.”
“What are you, my mom?” Amane jeered.
“I believe what I said is common sense. Also, shouldn’t you have tidied
up your room by now? There still isn’t any room to walk.”
Mahiru narrowed her eyes in obvious disappointment as she looked past
Amane at the room beyond, and Amane’s words stalled in his throat.
“...I have, a little.”
“No, you haven’t. Normally, people don’t drop their clothes on the
floor.”
“Those just...fell there.”
“That wouldn’t happen if you washed, dried, folded, and put them away
properly. Also, you should bundle up your magazines after you’re done
reading them. That way you won’t slip on one and fall.”
It wasn’t that he couldn’t sense the small barbs in her words, but he also
understood that Mahiru was, for some reason, genuinely concerned for him,
so he couldn’t dismiss everything she was saying. After all, the clutter of
magazines had almost tripped the both of them up just the other night. She
had a point.
Amane had no rebuttal. He screwed up his face, squeezed his mouth
shut tight, and sullenly took the container from Mahiru’s hand.
The food suffused his palm with a welcome warmth, especially after all
the time spent standing on his chilly veranda.
“So I can eat this?” Amane asked.
“If you don’t need it, I can throw it out,” Mahiru answered flatly.
“No, I’m grateful for it. I don’t usually get to eat an angel’s home
cooking.”
“...Stop calling me that, seriously.”
Using her school nickname was a kind of petty, needling revenge for her
critical comments. Her feelings about the moniker were written clearly


across her pale cheeks as they turned red.
There was no doubt about it—she hated being called an angel. Were he
in the same position, Amane was certain he would hate it, too. That hardly
needed to be said.
Despite understanding Mahiru’s stance, Amane couldn’t help but smile
when he saw her looking up at him with flushed cheeks and tiny, bitter tears
forming.
“I’m not going to say I’m sorry,” he declared.
It was clear that any further teasing would be certain to wreck what little
goodwill she had left for him, so Amane figured it was prudent to give it a
rest.
_We’re not even that close._
Mahiru also seemed not to want to hear any more, and she emphasized
this by clearing her throat forcefully as she pulled herself together.
Her cheeks were still tinged with red, though, so she didn’t look like
much had changed.
“Well, thank you for this. Though, you don’t really need to worry about
what happened before,” Amane said.
“I don’t. I considered that debt settled. This is for my own self-
satisfaction... I saw that you weren’t taking care of yourself, and I was
concerned; that’s all.”
Of course. Mahiru pitied him; that was it. There was no way to hide—
she’d gotten a very good look at how he lived the other night. Even now,
she could see the garbage piled up in the hallway behind him.
“You need to at least start eating proper meals and...get your life
together!” she scolded.
“Yes, Mom,” Amane answered sarcastically. He was getting a little tired
of listening to Mahiru’s nagging.
Amane churlishly carried the meal Mahiru had brought him back into
his apartment. He grabbed a pair of disposable chopsticks he’d gotten at the
supermarket and sat down on his living room couch, eager to sample the
flavors of her cooking.
He remembered enjoying the rice porridge that she’d brought him
before, even though his sense of taste had been dulled by sickness. The
slow-cooked porridge had possessed a rich, comforting taste that had been
gentle on his stomach. If that was any indication, Mahiru’s cooking was


undoubtedly quite good, but now it was time to find out for sure.
As he hastily opened the lid of the container, the savory scent of stew
drifted gently up at him. Various root vegetables had been cooked together
with some chicken. The light-colored sauce underscored the vibrant hues of
carrots and green beans, all of which had been cut into bite-size pieces.
Amane’s stomach growled, reminding him that the only thing he’d had
to eat was some nutritional jelly. He hastily snapped his disposable
chopsticks apart and brought a piece of daikon radish to his mouth.
“Yum.”
Amane’s mouth was greeted with a complex flavor.
Typical of the health-conscious Mahiru, the dish was only lightly
seasoned, spiced mostly with dashi stock. It was immediately obvious that
she hadn’t used store-bought, granulated dashi. Instead, she’d made it
herself using with dried bonito fish and kombu seaweed. The difference in
taste was night and day.
As he chewed it thoroughly, the flavor of the dashi and the other
seasonings, as well as the taste of the vegetables, spread gently through his
mouth. Amane had never been a fan of veggies. He usually went out of his
way to avoid them, but in this dish, the essence of each ingredient came
together in perfect harmony, and Amane happily savored them all.
There wasn’t much chicken. Perhaps Mahiru had done that on purpose
as if to tell him to eat more vegetables. What little meat there was had been
cooked plump and juicy. There was nothing to complain about there,
Amane thought, aside from the quantity. For something made by a high
school girl, the ingredients were a little plain, but her skill more than made
up for it. That Amane so readily enjoyed the food was enough of a
testament to that fact.
It would have been even better with some rice, and maybe some miso
soup or clear broth on the side, but Amane didn’t have any prepared. He
was all out of rice anyway, so that modest wish was not destined to be
granted that night. It was too late now, but he regretted not buying any
instant rice packets beforehand.
“That angel’s amazing,” Amane said to himself as he devoured the
perfectly seasoned vegetables, chopsticks never slowing for a second.
_To think, she’s great at school, and sports, and all kinds of housework._
If Mahiru had been there to hear Amane’s praise, she would have hated


it.

“Here’s this back. The food was good.”
The following evening, Amane carried the borrowed container over to
Mahiru’s apartment.
The boy was certainly bad at housework, but not so bad that he couldn’t
wash something before giving it back. In his hand, he held the carefully
cleaned little box, knowing that it was good manners to return it only after it
had been thoroughly washed and dried.
Mahiru had appeared the moment Amane rang the doorbell without even
checking to see who it was, as if she’d been expecting him.
She was wearing a wine-colored knit dress, and when she saw her
visitor, her eyes narrowed gently. She quickly checked the container and
said, “You washed it and everything, huh? Look at you.”
Amane frowned slightly when she praised him like a little child.
“Well, thank you for taking the time,” Mahiru continued. “Now take
this.” She pressed a new, warm container into Amane’s hand.
From what he could tell, there was sautéed pork and eggplant inside. It
seemed to have cooled enough that the lid hadn’t fogged up, for Amane
could clearly spy the color of eggplant, grilled pork, and sprinkled sesame
seeds through the clear top. From the color, he guessed the sauce was
probably miso flavor. The sight of the eggplant with slight scorch marks
and the lustrous pork definitely roused his appetite.
No one would deny that it looked delicious, but Amane couldn’t
understand why he’d been handed dinner again.
“No, um, I just came to return the container,” he tried to explain.
“This is today’s dinner,” Mahiru answered coolly.
“Yeah, I get that, but...”
“I just want to ask: You don’t have any allergies, do you? Don’t get the
wrong idea, though. I won’t be catering to your tastes or anything.”
“I don’t, but... I mean, I can’t accept your food again.”
Taking a portion of the girl’s dinner for the second time in a row seemed
wrong to Amane. His malnourished body was grateful for the food, and
Mahiru was clearly a much better cook than other girls her age, and the
meal he was holding was sure to be delicious, but it also held no small


amount of danger.
If someone from school saw the two of them meeting like this, it could
turn into a big debacle. That would be the end of Amane’s quiet student life
for sure.
These apartments were meant for single occupancy, but the rent was
pretty high because of the building’s location and the amenities. Amane had
never seen another student from their school in the building—except
Mahiru, of course—so he was probably worrying over nothing. Even with
that mild consolation, his brief meetings with the angel still made him wary.
“I made too much, so I’m just happy to be rid of it,” Mahiru explained.
“...In that case, I’m happy to take it. But someone might get the wrong
idea, since people usually do this sort of thing for someone they like...,”
Amane said sheepishly.
“And do _you_ have the wrong idea?”
“Uh, I guess not.”
One look at Mahiru’s expression was enough to clear up any
misconceptions about her feelings toward Amane.
There was no way that a beautiful, talented girl like Mahiru could
possibly fall for an oblivious slob like Amane. Sure, a cute next-door
neighbor bringing him food seemed like something out of a romantic
comedy, but there was no romance here—and certainly no comedy. The
situation was as devoid of those elements as Amane’s own apartment was
devoid of rice.
What kindness existed in the angel’s barbed words had been born only
from pity.
“Well then, there’s no problem, is there? And anyway, it looks like you
were surviving on convenience-store meals and side dishes from the
supermarket,” stated Mahiru.
“How could you tell?” Amane asked.
“It’s not hard to see that your kitchen has barely been used, and you
have a ton of disposable chopsticks from the convenience store and the
supermarket on your desk. Besides, I can tell just by looking at you. You’ve
got an unhealthy complexion.”
Amane’s expression froze. Mahiru had gotten all that just from one visit
to his apartment. Everything she’d said had been spot-on; he had no room
to argue.


“...All right, I’ll be going.”
Mahiru bowed and went back inside her apartment, having said what
she’d wanted to say and given him what she’d wanted to give.
Amane looked at the container in his hands as he listened to the jangling
sound of the chain on the other side of Mahiru’s front door slide into place.
The heat from the food was beginning to warm the palms of his hands. He
let out a soft sigh and returned to his place.
As expected, the stir-fried sesame miso eggplant and pork was delicious.
Amane found himself wishing even more than yesterday that he’d bought
some rice.

As time went on, Amane began swapping an empty container for a full one
every day, and his diet improved dramatically.
Mahiru’s cooking was always light and healthy, and since every dish
made him want rice, Amane started fixing microwave packets with each
meal. The angel had a variety of cuisines in her repertoire: Japanese,
Chinese, even Western. Each day brought something new, but every single
meal was delicious, and Amane developed an appetite like never before.
Like a wild animal grown fat on handouts, Amane quickly came to rely
on Mahiru’s charity. Even as he continued to obediently accept container
after container, he knew it was presumptuous to expect a meal every day.
Still, he happily—and hungrily—licked his chops each time.
“...You’re looking good lately. You fix your diet or something?”
Itsuki took a long, hard look at Amane one day during lunch.
Apparently, his complexion had improved—probably because he was
finally supplying his body with much-needed nutrition.
Amane knew his friend was perceptive, and he felt a bit of a cold sweat
break out as he slurped the udon noodles he’d ordered for school lunch.
“Itsuki, you scare me,” he said.
“Why’s that? Do you mean I’m right?”
“Uh, well, I guess you could say I’ve had no choice but to reexamine my
lifestyle recently.”
Whenever Amane passed by Mahiru near their apartments, she would
chide him gently to take care of himself, and she was regularly sharing her
dinner with him. It was only natural that his life had improved. On the one


hand, he wanted to call her his guardian angel, but a small part of him also
felt like she was meddling where it was none of her business.
Amane had indirectly confirmed Itsuki’s suspicions by dodging the
question, and Itsuki cackled with delighted laughter. “Yeah, I knew it. You
always looked unhealthy ’cause the way you were living was so crappy.”
“Shut up.”
“But what made you decide to ‘reexamine your lifestyle’?”
“I guess I was forced to.”
“Ah, your mom found out?”
“...You’re not right, but you’re not far off, either.”
Mahiru really did sound like Amane’s mom at times. She was much too
young and too cute to be a mother, though. Still, the way the girl went to
such lengths to care for Amane made it hard for him to refuse her.
“Say, Itsuki? Do I really seem that unhealthy?”
“Hmm... Well, to start with, you’re pretty pale. I guess you’re tall
enough, but you’re gangly. You’re also always shuffling around all
apathetic-like, so you look like a zombie.”
“But that’s just how I look...”
“You think I don’t know that? Try looking like one of the living for a
change.”
“Don’t be absurd... Wait, but seriously...a zombie...?”
Amane wasn’t really sure because he almost never bothered to closely
check his own face in the mirror, but apparently, he gave others the
impression that he was barely alive. If he looked half-dead even on a good
day, that would explain why Mahiru had been so worried about him before.
“You should pay a little more attention to how other people see you,
Amane. You’re always hunched over, starin’ at the ground. It makes you
hard to approach, and it’s not like you go out of your way to get close to
anybody, either. If I didn’t know any better, I’d say you’re the very
definition of a moody teenager.”
“You sure know how to keep it casual when you’re insulting a guy.”
“Fine, fine, I won’t sugarcoat it, then. You look like a corpse, and your
life is a mess.” Itsuki continued teasing his friend, insisting that he ought to
take this opportunity to pay more attention to his appearance and demeanor,
not to mention his health.
Sharply turning away, Amane replied sarcastically, “Thanks for your


concern.”


“Ah.”
Amane heard a beautiful voice ring out like a bell from behind him.
Recently, he’d grown accustomed to hearing that voice, but only around
his apartment building. Now he heard it while he was standing in the sweets
aisle at the neighborhood supermarket.
Amane had never expected Mahiru to acknowledge him in public, so he
turned around with some bewilderment to see her standing there, eyes wide.
A supermarket basket hung from her arm, and inside it sat a daikon
radish and some tofu, as well as a package of chicken thighs and a carton of
milk. These were likely the ingredients for her dinner tonight.
This was nothing special. Amane had coincidentally stopped by the
candy aisle at the same time. That was all.
“Just so you know, this is merely a coincidence,” Amane asserted. “It’s
not like I’m stalking you or anything.”
“I know, I know.” Mahiru nodded. “We’re both just here because it’s the
closest supermarket.” Before Amane had a chance to agree, he heard the
girl mutter, “Really, though, that’s the first thing that came to mind...?” She
stared down at a notebook that she was carrying.
It was just like the meticulous Mahiru to dutifully record everything she
needed. Ignoring Amane in favor of her flower-patterned notebook, Mahiru
brushed past the sweets and began searching the condiments on display in
the next aisle.
Something about Mahiru searching the shelves for kitchen staples and
murmuring things like _soy sauce_ and _mirin_ in her lovely voice seemed cute


to Amane. It was clear that the girl was in a strange kind of mood, however.
“Mirin is right here. Look,” Amane said, pointing it out.
“Ah, not that—I’m looking for the low-alcohol kind. I can’t buy that,
since I’m underage,” Mahiru replied.
“This is considered alcohol?”
“Mirin is sweet rice wine, after all. The ones that are specifically for
cooking still have alcohol, but they add in salt to make it gross to drink, so
even underage people can buy it.”
Amane had been about to hand her a bottle of mirin when she suddenly
refused it, shook her head, and instead placed the low-alcohol alternative in
her basket.
“Learn something every day...” This was all new to Amane, who did so
little housework that even these simple tidbits seemed revelatory. He
watched Mahiru as she moved quickly on down the aisle, stopping in front
of a shelf full of soy sauce.
Mahiru frowned, as if she had only just noticed the price labels. “...
Bargain price, limit one bottle per person...” She had apparently been
intending to buy a spare. Mahiru grumbled in disappointment and turned to
glance at Amane.
“Maybe...I could buy one, too?” Amane quickly sensed what Mahiru
had been trying to convey with her eyes, and with a wry smile, he picked up
a bottle of soy sauce. When he did, her lips formed a satisfied arch.
“It’s helpful to have someone who understands,” she said.
“...You’re more economical than I expected,” Amane commented.
“Well, I don’t see why I shouldn’t find the best prices when I can. Cut
down on needless expense, right?”
“I wonder if that’s what they call a thrifty mentality. Well, as long as
you’re living on an allowance from your parents, I guess that’s for the best.”
Amane may have technically lived alone, but in reality, his parents still
supported him. His family was fairly rich, and they covered the rent of his
clean, safe apartment, took care of his school fees, and provided him with a
more-than-fair allowance. Amane had never had to worry about his
expenses, but he was grateful for everything his parents did for him, so he
tried not to waste money.
“...That’s right. We depend on their support, so it’s important to be
frugal,” Mahiru replied matter-of-factly, taking stock of the contents of her


basket. Her voice was cold, like something had stolen away her warmth.
Amane flinched at Mahiru’s flat tone, but when she looked up from her
groceries, her expression had returned to normal. The gloomy eyes he’d
seen in that brief moment were already gone.
“...Anyway, are you really buying that?” Mahiru asked, as if to change
the subject, looking at the packs of instant rice and the container of potato
salad that were in the basket that Amane was holding.
The meals that Mahiru was sharing with him were, of course, delicious,
but they weren’t enough on their own. To compensate, Amane would pick
up a staple food and side salad like he’d done today.
“I mean, it’s dinner,” Amane explained.
“It’s unhealthy,” Mahiru shot back.
“You’re so fussy. I’m buying a salad, aren’t I?”
“A _potato_ salad... How is your body still functioning?”
“Mind your own business.”
Mahiru put wordless pressure on him, scrutinizing him with eyes that
reproached him and told him to eat more vegetables. Amane turned away
and let Mahiru go ahead of him.
Chatting about this and that, the two bought their respective things.
Amane had started to pack his purchases into a plastic bag, but Mahiru
produced a reusable bag she’d brought and quickly put everything into it.
She was truly an environmentally conscious angel.
Mahiru had only brought the one bag, however, and Amane was a little
anxious that the quantity of groceries was too much for it.
With the milk, soy sauce, and low-alcohol cooking mirin, that was four
liters of liquid altogether, and if they weighed anything like water, that
meant four kilograms right there. There was still the whole daikon radish
and the other ingredients to consider, too. The bag had to be really heavy.
Everything was packed in quite neatly, but still, it would surely be hard
work carrying it all the way back to Amane and Mahiru’s building.
_She’s been cooking for me, so she must be going through more
seasonings and ingredients than she normally does.
She’s gotta be making a lot in order to split the dishes with me. The
amount she gives me is always nearly a whole meal’s worth. Mahiru says
it’s all just extra, but she must be making a lot of food on purpose._
After Mahiru had gone through so much trouble to take care of Amane,


it’d wound his pride if he didn’t do anything to help her out now.
As soon as Mahiru finished packing the reusable bag, Amane took hold
of the handles and lifted it. It wasn’t all that heavy to him, of course, but he
could tell that it would definitely be difficult for her to carry for very long.
Mahiru may have been really good at sports, but pure arm strength was
an entirely different matter. Surely, Amane thought, his eyes tracing her
slim figure under her clothing, surely there was no way that her slender
arms could command the power needed to lift these heavy groceries.
Caramel-colored eyes blinked rapidly. Mahiru looked surprised—or
maybe a little concerned.
“...I’m not stealing it or anything,” Amane said in his defense.
“I’m not worried about that,” Mahiru replied. “It’s just...I can carry my
own bags, you know?”
“It’d be more charming if you’d be quiet and let me take care of you for
a change,” quipped Amane.
“That’s basically saying I’m not charming,” Mahiru answered flatly.
“Well, think about how you act at school, then compare that to how you
act toward me.”
Mahiru took a step back. Maybe Amane had unknowingly hit a nerve.
The version of herself that she showed at school—the kind, gentle, modest
girl everyone was familiar with—that was not the person Amane knew. Yes,
Mahiru was always kind to him, but she was also far more direct. She never
sugarcoated anything or hid behind niceties. Everything she said to him was
brief and frank.
Amane took advantage of Mahiru’s stunned silence and briskly
sauntered off toward the supermarket exit, holding his schoolbag in one
hand and the reusable shopping bag stuffed with groceries in the other. He
was leaving her behind, but he didn’t care. Unconcerned, he continued on
as the gap between them grew wider. He didn’t slow down or give her a
chance to catch up.
They had already been standing next to each other in the supermarket,
after all. If they walked side by side on the way home and somebody saw
them, that could start rumors.
So really, this kind of distance was best for both of them.
Amane hurried on with his heavy burden while pretending not to be
aware of Mahiru.


As he strode along, he thought he heard someone mutter “Thanks”
behind him.


Amane was terrible at housework of any kind, but the thing he was worst at
was cleaning.
Surprisingly, he actually could cook. More specifically, he could prepare
something hot and usually technically edible, as long as he was willing to
set aside petty concerns like presentation or flavor and also assumed the
possibility of grievous bodily injury at some point during the process. He
wasn’t completely incapable of preparing food.
Laundry was all right, too. That much was possible for anyone, even
Amane. If push came to shove, there was always the option of taking his
clothes to a coin laundromat. All it boiled down to was a matter of stuffing
everything into the machine and letting it run with detergent and water
inside. Amane could pull that off, no problem. The one thing he was
absolutely hopeless with, however, was cleaning.
“What do I do?”
One weekend, Amane had finally gotten tired of listening to both
Mahiru and Itsuki lecture him day in and day out about cleaning his
apartment and had resolved to finally do something about it. The only
problem was that Amane was at a complete loss on how to get started.
He knew that this was his own fault, but the first problem was that his
things were piled up all over the place, and he couldn’t figure out how he
could even begin to get them in order. Unsure of what else to do, Amane
started by washing his bedsheets and airing out his futon.
_What should come next?_ he wondered. _Clothes and magazines are_


_scattered everywhere, so there’s really no room to walk._
One small mercy was that he always threw out any food garbage right
away, so there were no awful stenches or greasy stains. It was simply an
enormous amount of clutter—enough that it seemed like an insurmountable
problem.
As Amane sighed softly at the mountain of work before him, the
doorbell rang. He let out a little gasp.
Rather than a regular visitor, he had begun to think of his neighbor more
like a delivery person, a blessing from above who just handed over gifts and
then left. As he stood before his messy room, however, Mahiru seemed like
a savior.
Amane scrambled for his front door but couldn’t find his footing. He
stumbled, caught himself, and carefully crept the rest of the way to the door
with one hand pressed against the wall for balance.
“Sorry, I wanted to pick up my container a little earlier today... What
are you doing?” Mahiru asked when Amane opened the door.
“...I was trying to clean,” he admitted.
Mahiru looked at Amane, still off-balance, with a rather astonished
expression.
“I heard a loud noise just now,” she said.
“...I almost fell.”
“I bet you did. You haven’t even begun to clean, have you?”
“I wasn’t sure how to start.”
“I can tell.”
Amane grimaced at Mahiru’s comment. It was no less candid than usual,
and Amane really couldn’t think of anything to justify his lack of progress.
Besides, he knew that if he got sulky now and lashed out, he wouldn’t be
able to get her advice on how to go about cleaning his apartment. The
trouble was that he wasn’t sure how exactly to ask for Mahiru’s help.
_I was hoping for some cleaning tips, but I wonder if she’ll actually give
me any advice..._
Amane hesitated when he saw that Mahiru was peering past him at the
clutter beyond. Her eyes conveyed her shock at the disastrous scene behind
him. It truly must’ve been an awful sight.
“Unbelievable... I’ll help you clean your apartment.”
“Huh?”


Even Amane knew that it would be too shameless to ask Mahiru to help
him clean. That’s why he’d only been planning to see if she had any
suggestions. Never had he dared to imagine that Mahiru would come right
out and offer to help.
“I hate the idea that the apartment next to mine is so filthy.” Such
scathing words, but again, Amane could offer no argument. “You must
think it’s so easy to live alone, but you can’t even clean up after yourself.
Worse, you act like it’s no problem, like everything will sort itself out
eventually, but it clearly hasn’t. Why don’t you stop and take a moment to
look at yourself?”
Amane was at a loss for words. His mother had always told him that if
he was diligent about cleaning regularly, it would be easy, but he’d ignored
her, and this was the result. He was fully aware that he was suffering the
consequences of his own actions.
“Look, as long as you keep up with routine cleaning, your place won’t
get this bad again. It’s obvious that you have some terrible habits,” Mahiru
said.
“...You’re absolutely right,” agreed Amane.
He couldn’t get angry with her. He already owed her so much, and she’d
been so kind to him. Besides, everything she was saying about his past
behavior was true. He _had_ underestimated how difficult living alone would
be, and he really did just sort of assume that everything would somehow
work itself out, and _this_ was the result. Amane could only nod solemnly at
Mahiru’s words.
“Well, is it all right if I start with this room?” Mahiru asked.
“...Is it all right with you?” Amane answered with a question of his
own.
“I’m the one who’s offering, so of course it’s all right. I’m going to go
get ready, so while I do, if you have anything you don’t want me to see, or
any valuables, please put them in a closet and lock them up.”
“I’m not worried about that.”
Amane refused to even entertain the idea that someone who had been so
kind to him, even despite her sharp words, might steal from him. Not to
mention that Mahiru was far too good-hearted to ever harm another person
like that.
“...You’re not?” she inquired.


“There’s no way that you would do something like that,” Amane replied.
“No, that’s not what I... Look, aren’t you worried that I might see
something that, as a boy, you’d rather hide?”
“Ah...uh, well, unfortunately I don’t happen to have any such things.”
“Well, in that case, it’s fine, then. All right, I’m going to go change
clothes and fetch some cleaning supplies. I don’t take cleaning lightly, you
know.”
Mahiru returned to her apartment, and Amane watched her go with a
wry smile.

She came back wearing different clothes: a long white T-shirt and khaki-
colored cargo pants. The T-shirt closely followed the lines of her body, the
delicate fabric bringing the curves and edges into full relief. Mahiru’s long
hair had been skillfully gathered into a perfectly round bun, and Amane felt
strangely uncomfortable being able to see the white nape of her neck.
Previously, he had only ever seen her in dresses and skirts, and he found
there was something refreshing about this look. Amane had thought before
that boyish clothes like this probably wouldn’t suit her well, but he had
clearly been wrong. He was beginning to realize that beautiful girls looked
good in whatever they put on.
This new outfit looked comfortable for moving around the house, but it
was also a look that Mahiru could’ve worn around town. Amane never
would’ve imagined that these were clothes that she was okay with getting
dirtied.
“You don’t mind if those get messed up?” Amane asked.
“I was planning to throw these out soon anyway, so it’s fine if they get a
bit dirty.” Mahiru scanned the cataclysm that was Amane’s apartment and
sighed softly. “I’m only going to say this once: We’re going to clean
_thoroughly_ , got it?”
“...I understand.”
“Good, then let’s get to it. I’m not going to go easy on you, and I won’t
let this end halfway through. I assume you have no objections?” Mahiru had
posed the question so forcefully that Amane could do nothing but
sheepishly reply in the affirmative.
So began the great battle to clean Amane’s apartment. A battle


spearheaded by an angel.
“First things first, let’s toss any clothes into the laundry basket. Usually
when you clean, you work from top to bottom, but we have to handle the
clutter on the floor first before we can run the vacuum cleaner. Before we
start the wash, we can divide the clothes into different loads, since there are
too many to wash at once. Do you want to split them into things you wear
and things you don’t wear? Or do you want to wash everything?”
“Just do it however you like...,” replied Amane. It seemed so obvious to
him now. Of course they had to clear the floor before trying to do anything
else.
“...There isn’t any underwear out here or anything, right?”
“Those are in my dresser, as you would expect.”
“That’s fine, then. We can probably put off washing clothes for now,
since even if we wash and dry them, we’ll kick up dust by cleaning and just
end up having to do them again. If you’re not in a hurry, you can do the
laundry after we finish cleaning.”
“Okay.”
“...Now, regarding the magazines. Really, the only thing to do is to
throw them out. I suppose it’s a bit of a different story if you’re collecting
them, but from the way you keep them piled up everywhere, I doubt that’s
the case. If you do want to hold on to some part of one, tear out the page
and put it in a scrapbook, then dispose of the rest. Tie up any magazines
you’re getting rid of and put them out for collection.”
Mahiru set about the task of cleaning right away, directing Amane to put
his discarded clothing into the laundry basket as she gathered up every last
magazine. She told him to speak now if there were any that Amane wanted
to keep, but there weren’t any in particular that he needed, so he simply
shook his head. Having received the answer she required, Mahiru skillfully
tied up the bundle using some plastic cord that she had apparently brought
with her.
“When you’re finished gathering the clothes, please go through the other
assorted clutter and decide whether to throw anything out. All these
different things on the floor: same as before, sort them into what you need
to keep and what you don’t. Then put the latter in the trash. Got it?”
“...Uh-huh,” Amane answered meekly.
“If you have a problem with taking orders, you’d better tell me now.”


“No, I don’t, but...I was just thinking about how quick you’re doing all
of this.”
“If I don’t, we’ll run out of time. It’s total chaos in here, after all.”
“You’re right.”
Even though it was the weekend, time was limited. If they were going to
run the vacuum, it would have to be during the day, considering that the
noise would be a nuisance to the neighbors. Since Mahiru knew that it
would take a lot of effort to get the place to a state where they could
vacuum, she was working to tidy up as quickly as possible.
One part of Amane felt bad for letting her do so much. On the other
hand, under Mahiru’s direction, more and more of the floor began to appear
for the first time in a long while.
“Professor Shiina...,” Amane muttered.
“If you’re going to ask for guidance from me like I’m a teacher, first
learn by imitating. I’m not going to sort through your personal effects, so
please be diligent and keep only what you really need,” Mahiru instructed.
“Yes, sir.”
“Please don’t address me as a man.”
The angel nonchalantly returned Amane’s jabs as she skillfully cleared
up more of the clutter with a serious expression the whole time.
Amane had a bad habit of hoarding useless junk, and he was both
grateful for Mahiru’s decisiveness and envious of it. Here she was, in a
stranger’s apartment, picking through the mess without hesitation. She
really was the spitting image of an angel.
Mahiru was so efficient that she could have easily cleaned up the whole
place by herself had she wanted to. However, likely because she was in
such a hurry, she got careless about watching her footing. There was no
doubt that it was Amane’s fault for leaving it on the floor, but Mahiru
slipped on a piece of discarded clothing and lost her balance.
The instant a small “Ah!” escaped Mahiru’s mouth, Amane dived across
the room, aiming for the spot where he thought Mahiru would most likely
fall.
A light, sweet fragrance mixed with the musty smell of the dust that had
been kicked up in the panic.
Amane landed on his backside, leaving his rear end to suffer a dull sting,
but it was tolerable. He groaned just a bit as he felt the weight of Mahiru


pressing down on him.
_She must be happy that I caught her right away._
“...Fujimiya?” Mahiru looked up at him. She didn’t seem angry, but she
didn’t seem particularly happy about the situation, either. Mostly, she just
sounded surprised. “I can accept the blame for falling, but this is exactly
why you must tidy up, because otherwise things like this are bound to
happen.”
“I’m really sorry, honestly... You’re not hurt, are you?” Amane asked.
“I’m fine. Thanks for going out of your way to catch me. I’m sorry,
too.”
“No, it’s all my fault...”
Amane wouldn’t have been able to bear it if Mahiru had gotten hurt
while helping him, especially considering she was already sharing meals
with him. That would’ve been absolutely unforgivable; he wouldn’t have
even been able to look her in the eye.
If he needed to, he was considering kneeling and asking for forgiveness,
but Mahiru didn’t seem too upset over her tumble.
“We’re cleaning up so that things like this don’t happen anymore,
understand?”
“Yeah. I’m really very sorry.”
“It’s fine; you don’t need to apologize. I’m helping you because I feel
like it, after all.” Mahiru looked just a little bit flustered as she gazed up at
Amane.
Amane suddenly realized how close they were and was aware of her
pressing against him. For a boy who basically never interacted with girls on
a regular basis, this was a heart-pounding situation. Even though neither of
them had any romantic feelings for the other, something felt very wrong
about it somehow.
Mahiru didn’t seem to be conscious of the situation, so Amane gently
grabbed her shoulder and pushed her off of him; then he stood up before the
awkwardness could show on his face.
“...Should we...keep cleaning?” he managed after a moment.
“Yes, that’s a good idea,” Mahiru replied. Fortunately for Amane, she
appeared to be oblivious to his trembling as she grabbed the hand Amane
extended and rose to her feet.
Mahiru seemed unaware of how closely she’d been pressed up against


him, because she just maintained her usual expression. Amane figured that
a girl like Mahiru must’ve been used to the attention of a lot of boys. Surely
a little contact like that wouldn’t be enough to unnerve her like it did him.
Smiling wryly at Mahiru’s demeanor, Amane decided it would be wrong
to leave everything up to her and returned to cleaning with newfound
resolve. Even though the task was wholly unfamiliar, he did his best to
struggle through.
“...You are full of surprises.”
Amane was too focused on his work to notice the quiet words that
escaped Mahiru’s lips, nor did he see that her ears, hidden by her straw-
colored hair, had turned slightly red.

“...Whew, now, this is clean.”
In the end, it had taken the pair the entire day to clean Amane’s
apartment.
Several hours were spent tidying up the clutter on his floor, and then,
between washing the clothes, dusting the shelves and light fixtures,
scrubbing the windows, and vacuuming, the entire day had flown by before
they knew it.
The sun had been visible when Mahiru came over, but it had long since
set by now, proof of just how long she and Amane had been working.
It had certainly been no small task, but those efforts were not without
results. Amane’s apartment was so clean that he barely recognized it. There
was no unnecessary clutter, and he could see the floor! Once-dirty
windowpanes and frames didn’t have a single speck of dirt on them. The
lights, too, shone brighter now that they had been dusted. The place was
finally clean. Without all the junk crowding every surface, it actually looked
to be quite a comfortable space.
“To think that it took us a whole day,” Mahiru observed.
“Guess that’s what it takes when it’s such a mess...,” Amane answered.
“But it was _your_ mess.”
“R-right you are.”
Amane verbally prostrated himself before his angelic savior, who had
taken mercy on him. Mahiru, who had wasted one of her precious weekend
days helping him, finished tying up a garbage bag with a beleaguered look.


She didn’t seem upset, but a hint of fatigue showed on her face, though it
was mixed with a sense of accomplishment. That was only natural, since
she had been working all day.
After everything that had transpired, Amane would have been ashamed
to simply let Mahiru go make dinner. It’d be unforgivable to expect her to
do any more work, whether she shared a portion of her cooking with him
today or not.
“Now that it’s evening, I don’t feel like going shopping, so I’m going to
order a pizza or something. Please let me treat you today. After all, you’ve
been giving me all kinds of food and stuff,” Amane offered.
“Oh, but—,” Mahiru started, but she was quickly cut off.
“If you don’t want to eat with me, I’ll order one for you, and you can
take it home.”
This gesture was more about showing gratitude than trying to get
Mahiru to eat with him, so if she wanted to eat alone, Amane didn’t mind.
“...That’s not what I meant. It’s just... I was surprised, because I’ve
never ordered pizza.”
“Huh, you’ve never ordered pizza?”
“Yeah, I live alone, but I’ve never ordered pizza... I’ve made it myself,
though.”
“It’s amazing that you would even think to make it,” Amane exclaimed.
Normally, if someone decided they wanted pizza, the three options were
to buy a ready-made one at the store, get it delivered, or go eat it in a
restaurant. He was sure that there were very few people who would think to
go through the long, laborious process of making one from scratch.
“Well, there’s nothing strange about ordering pizza for delivery,” Amane
asserted. “I do it all the time myself: order delivery or go to a family
restaurant solo...you know, like most people.”
“I’ve actually never been to one of those, either,” Mahiru admitted.
“Now, _that_ is rare. I go alone pretty often, and my parents go to
restaurants whenever they don’t feel like cooking. I guess your parents
aren’t the type to eat out often, huh?”
“...In our house, the help made the meals.”
“The help? Damn, you must be really rich.”
Finding out that Mahiru was fabulously wealthy explained a lot. It
certainly cleared up why Mahiru’s mannerisms were so graceful and refined


—and why her clothes and possessions were always top quality. Even the
girl’s gait seemed to speak of an affluent upbringing.
At Amane’s words, Mahiru broke into a thin smile. “You’re right; I think
I am comparatively well-off.”
Quickly, Amane began to regret what he’d said, realizing that Mahiru’s
smile was not one of delight or pride but rather a display of self-mockery. It
seemed that her family was an area of discussion that was better left alone,
and Amane didn’t plan to pry any further.
_Everybody has a thing or two they’d rather not talk about. It’s only
polite to respect that, especially with people you don’t know very well._
“Well, then this will be an interesting experience, won’t it? Here, order
what you like.”
Dropping the topic of Mahiru’s parents, Amane showed her a menu for a
pizza place Amane occasionally ordered from. Out of all the places that
delivered, it was the best. Their pizza was no match for one cooked in an
authentic wood-fired oven, of course, but they did offer a wide variety of
toppings. Their choices ranged from the standard fare to stuff more suited to
little kids, so Amane figured that there was sure to be something that would
appeal to Mahiru’s tastes.
Mahiru accepted both the change of subject and the pizza menu. She
immediately began poring over the list of options, her luminous brown eyes
drawn to the many colorful photos of different pizzas. Her eyes weren’t
usually very expressive, but now they shimmered vividly.
_She must really be looking forward to this_ , Amane thought.
Mahiru seemed a bit nervous, but after considering it for a little while,
she pointed out a party pizza with four types of toppings and said hesitantly,
“All right, this looks good.” She turned an expectant gaze to Amane.
With a slight smile, Amane nodded, picked up his phone, and dialed the
number printed on the menu. Mahiru’s eyes sparkled with anticipation.
An hour later, their pizza arrived. Mahiru dug in without hesitation. The
pizza was divided into sections to allow the different flavors to be sampled
on their own, and she’d hesitated a little over which one to try first but
finally decided to start with a piece covered with a hearty helping of bacon
and sausage.
Amane was not surprised when Mahiru nibbled at her slice with small,
delicate bites. He supposed her refined upbringing had taught her to eat


everything with poise and grace, even delivery pizza.
Watching Mahiru gave Amane a warm feeling inside, like he was
watching a small, cute animal. She was strangely adorable as her eyes
closed and her expression relaxed a little while she chewed on the stretchy
cheese. Usually, the girl appeared so mature; in this moment, however, she
finally looked her age.
Amane quelled an intense urge to pat Mahiru’s head as she enjoyed the
pizza with little, mincing bites.
“...What?” she asked.
“Nothing, you just look like you’re enjoying it,” Amane replied.
“Please don’t stare at me so much.”
The frown she cast at Amane was anything but cute, however.
“...Geez, you’ve really got no charm.”
“Well, that suits me fine. If I were to act like I always do at school,
you’d say I was making you uncomfortable.”
“Yeah, I guess that’s true. I’m more familiar with this version of you
than the school version.”
At school, Amane barely ever even saw Mahiru, and they had certainly
never spoken there. He only occasionally caught a glimpse of her, and she
always wore that same, impenetrable smile that she showed to everyone.
Here, he got to see beyond that layer. _This has to be the real Mahiru_ ,
Amane thought. At school, she always adopted her fake, public persona.
“As far as I’m concerned,” he continued, “I never get tired of this
version.”
“The version with no charm?”
“Don’t hold a grudge... You know, how do I put this...? I can never tell
what you’re thinking when you’re at school.”
“Mostly about my schedule and my classes, I suppose.”
“So even you can be clueless once in a while, huh?”
Amane had meant to say that Mahiru always looked like she had some
secret on her mind, but Mahiru apparently took his words at face value. She
looked at him with a subtle protest in her eyes, as though she had meant
something else entirely.
“I, uh, didn’t mean it like that,” Amane quickly added. “It’s just... You
don’t show what you’re thinking. All I meant was that it’s easier to be
around someone who’s honest about their feelings, even if they’re a little


rude, than someone who you can never read.”
“...Do you think how I behave at school is bad?” Mahiru asked directly.
“Well, I can’t really hate on it, since it’s probably the secret to your
success. I just wonder if you ever get tired of it,” Amane said.
“Not really. I’ve been acting like that since I was little.”
“Hard-core, huh?”
If she’d been keeping up this act since childhood, spending her whole
life trying to be the perfect young woman everyone expected her to be,
Amane could understand how it would definitely be difficult for her to set
that persona aside.
Amane had been able to infer a little bit about Mahiru’s home life, but
he knew that there was no way he could ask her more about it.
“Well, isn’t it nice to have a place where you can relax? And now
you’ve even got a buddy to chill with.”
“Honestly, I don’t find you relaxing at all. You make my stomach turn in
knots,” Mahiru stated coldly.
“I’m...sorry?” Amane apologized, a little dumbstruck.
Mahiru gave an exaggerated shrug and let out a strange little laugh.


After the day-long cleanup, Amane felt like the wall between Mahiru and
him had become ever-so-slightly thinner, but that didn’t necessarily mean
they had become much closer.
They still had absolutely zero contact at school; they would make small
talk sometimes when he went to get his portion of dinner from her, but that
was all.
Just the other day, Mahiru had scolded Amane, telling him that he had to
keep his apartment tidy. Her words were definitely stern, but they also made
it clear that she actually did care about him, at least a bit.
Since Amane was receiving frequent reminders and tips on cleaning, his
apartment remained as nice as it had been when he and Mahiru had finished
tidying up the place.
“Wow, it really is clean.” That was the first thing Itsuki said when he
came over on a day off. He muttered in an astonished voice when he saw
the drastic transformation the living room had undergone.
“I never thought your place could look this good. It was so dirty. I
remember I helped you pick up stuff once before, but it was a wreck the
very next day.”
“Give it a rest,” Amane shot back at his friend.
“No, but seriously, think about it. What’s the longest number of days
you’ve gone without dropping something on your floor?”
“This is easily a new record. I’ve kept it going for two weeks.”
“Two weeks?! That’s it? That’s nothing to be proud of, you know?”
Amane scowled a little. He was now keenly aware that normally, people


did not leave their things lying around on the floor. Still, he knew that Itsuki
was only speaking from a place of kindness and common sense, so Amane
couldn’t say much. After all, Itsuki had helped him out, too, long before
Mahiru ever had, so Amane knew he shouldn’t act like a jerk.
Itsuki smiled cheerfully at Amane’s sullen silence. “Hey, I guess if your
apartment’s this clean, I could even bring Chi over.”
“No way; why should I have to watch you two flirting in my own
home?”
“No need to be shy, buddy.”
“Don’t turn my place into your hangout!”
_Why should I have to watch my friend and his girlfriend getting all
lovey-dovey?_
Amane wished Itsuki could understand his position and appreciate what
kind of torture it was like to have to watch a sickeningly sweet couple
flirting all the time. He knew that Itsuki was just joking about bringing Chi
over, but even so, Amane didn’t find it very amusing that he constantly had
front-row seats to their cloying relationship.
“Relax, it was just a joke. Anyway, now that you’ve finally got the place
clean, don’t go messing it up again, you hear?”
“I’ve got it under control,” Amane assured.
“Someone like you... Well, whatever. Just make sure you get in the
habit of putting things away after you take them out.”
“Are you my mom...?”
“Now, Amane, dearie, you have to be diligent about cleaning your
room!” Itsuki mocked.
“That’s so creepy; you sound so much like my mom, it’s scary!”
Amane felt a shiver rocket down his back when Itsuki scolded him in a
forced falsetto.
He was sure Itsuki had never even met his mother, but still, the
impression had hit a nerve. Itsuki’s impersonation of a lady wasn’t
particularly soothing, either. Amane stuck out his tongue at him, and Itsuki
cackled with amusement.
“Is that what your mom’s like, Amane? Because mine is really cold
toward me...”
“Actually, I’m jealous. My mom bugs me whenever she gets the
chance.”


“She sounds like a mom who really cares about her son.”
“I think she’s just overly attached...”
“No, I’m sure she has to look after you because you’re such a slob.”
“Oh, shut up. I mean it, you know, that my mom is too clingy.”
Perhaps because Amane was an only child, his mother was always
fussing over him.
She didn’t exactly spoil him, but she did poke her nose around in his
business and read too much into things. Amane certainly didn’t hate her, but
she made him uncomfortable at times.
His mother had given him all sorts of instructions when he’d left home
to live on his own and attend high school, and sometimes she would show
up to check on him without warning. The pop-ins could be pretty awful.
“Well, doesn’t that just show how much she treasures you, Amane?”
“And her love is a heavy burden.”
“Oh, I give up. You’re the kind of guy who never appreciates what he’s
got till it’s gone.”
“You talk like you’ve got it all figured out, but don’t you have your own
problems dealing with that kind of meddling?”
“Ha-ha! It’s Chi, man; what else can I do?” Itsuki had all sorts of issues
when it came to his father and his girlfriend, so his lecture really didn’t
have much weight behind it. Even so, Amane knew there was some truth to
what his friend was saying, so he didn’t argue any further.
Itsuki sighed quietly, as if to tell Amane to let him worry about his own
problems. His expression remained cheerful and carefree, however. “I’ll
mess up anybody who interferes with me and Chi!” Itsuki said, declaring
something a little unsettling. “Anyway, I’ll figure out something for my dad
situation, so it’s all good. For the time being, how ’bout you sort your life
out, Amane?”
Itsuki laughed loudly, and Amane responded by making a sour face. “I
know that; you don’t have to tell me.” He smiled secretly to himself,
however, thinking how he’d heard that before from another person recently.
Itsuki had come to visit Amane’s apartment in order to see how he was
living. Well, actually, he’d mostly come to hang out and mess around, so
their discussion about the state of the room quickly wrapped up, and before
long, they were playing a video game. Their initial intention had been to
study for a test the next week, but that notion had been quickly discarded.


“Careful with the health packs; we’re gonna run out,” Amane said.
“We’ll think of something; it’ll be fine,” Itsuki answered.
“Not at this level it won’t...”
As Amane pondered how best to deal with his less cautious co-op
player, the sound of the doorbell rang through the room and immediately
gave rise to a different worry.
“Hmm? A visitor?”
Itsuki looked up, too, after pausing the game. He knew that Amane had
never really told anyone else where he lived, and that he didn’t have any
friends who might visit him at home, besides Itsuki himself. More
importantly, any regular visitor would have been stopped at the lobby
downstairs anyway, so a page should have come through the intercom.
“I don’t really know, but it must be a neighbor, right? Distributing a
community notice or something,” Amane fibbed, knowing quite well who it
likely was.
“Ah, gotcha,” Itsuki answered.
“I’ll just be a minute.”
Amane did his best to dispel Itsuki’s suspicions and hurried toward the
front door, struggling to hide the twitch in his face that might give him
away. He was lucky that Mahiru hadn’t called out to him after ringing the
buzzer.
He opened the door quickly, not bothering to check who it was, and
slipped through the small opening to get outside where he couldn’t be seen.
Amane made sure to close the door behind himself.
Just as he’d suspected, it was Mahiru standing there, blinking in surprise
at Amane, who must have appeared to have been acting very unusual.
Immediately, he pressed an index finger to his lips and shushed Mahiru.
“...Please speak softly. Itsuki is here.”
“Itsuki?” she asked.
“My friend. He came over to play games.”
“Ah, okay.”
Mahiru nodded in understanding of Amane’s secretive behavior, then
passed him a food container as she did every day without bothering to
question him any further.
Inside was a type of stew called _oden_ , the perfect dish for the season
now that the weather had gotten cold. Mahiru had probably been preparing


it since morning. Amane accepted it with gratitude and let out a soft sigh as
he looked at Mahiru. There was really no reason she ought to be doing this
every day.
“Look, I really appreciate what you do, but...I don’t have a lot of time.
Sorry,” Amane apologized.
“I wasn’t waiting to be thanked or anything... I’m glad, you know, that
we cleaned up enough that you can invite friends over,” Mahiru answered.
“I guess I should kneel down and thank you.”
“No way; don’t do that.”
Mahiru looked at him with astonishment in her eyes. Perhaps she
thought getting Amane to do something like that would make her akin to a
tyrant. Amane smiled wryly.
There had been a bit of earnestness in his statement, because he truly
was indebted to her. She’d done so much for him that he really ought to be
on his knees. Amane couldn’t reconcile continuing to accept all the food for
free, so he decided that he wanted to discuss paying her for the meals at
some later date.
“Well, if your friend is here, I suppose you can’t talk for too long.
Excuse me.”
“...You’re always helping me out. I’ll make sure to keep this secret from
Itsuki.”
“Please do.”
“I mean, even if I told him everything, he probably won’t believe me.”
“I suppose not.”
Mahiru’s honest confirmation raised some complex feelings for Amane,
but he knew she was right. If he was in Itsuki’s shoes and someone told him
that Mahiru Shiina had been making meals for him daily, he definitely
wouldn’t believe them. Anyone would dismiss such a claim as a fantasy.
That was how out of reach this angel was.
Normally, it would be impossible to imagine Mahiru treating even a
handsome, superior man to her home cooking, let alone a mediocre and
slovenly guy like Amane. Hell would sooner freeze over.
“...Can I ask you one thing?” Amane called.
“What is it?” Mahiru stopped before entering her apartment.
“What good does it do you to keep sharing your meals with me?”
Typically, people didn’t give away food for free—they expected


something in return. Amane probably wouldn’t have thought about doing
the same for Mahiru if their positions had been reversed. Even though he
didn’t believe for a moment that there was even the slightest possibility that
she had feelings for him, he couldn’t help but wonder.
At Amane’s question, Mahiru gaze wandered upward as if she was
giving it a bit of thought herself, then, without any change to her
expression, answered, “My own self-satisfaction. There’s nothing more to
it. It’s just as easy for me to cook for two people as it is for one, and I guess
I simply like treating people.”
“So it’s because you like to cook?”
“Well, there’s that, too. I think it’s also because I can give you food
without you getting any weird ideas, and you’ll genuinely tell me that my
cooking’s tasty without any ulterior motives. Plus, it’s satisfying for me
because I was concerned after seeing your eating habits.”
“...Is that how it is?” Amane pressed, just the slightest bit disappointed.
“That’s how it is. So don’t worry about it. Just think of it as...a sudden
bout of good fortune.”
“Yes, ma’am.”
Mahiru didn’t seem like she was going to give him any more of an
answer than that, and after bowing courteously, she said “Pardon me” and
returned to her own apartment.
“I guess that’s how it goes,” Amane mumbled to himself. “I still don’t
think it’s right for her to give it to me for free, though.” He opened the door
back into his own place.
“Who was it?” Itsuki asked.
“My neighbor. She gave me some of her dinner. I’m gonna put it in the
fridge, so don’t restart the game without me,” Amane replied.
“Ah, sorry, I already beat the boss.”
“You gotta be kidding me.”


Every day on his way home, Amane passed the park where he and Mahiru
had properly met for the first time.
The building where Amane lived was less of a family-use apartment
complex and more aimed at single people and couples, so there were few
children around, and the surrounding apartment buildings were much the
same.
Tucked away and out of sight, the little park close to Amane’s building
was often deserted. It was in that little park devoid of children, Amane saw
Mahiru for the second time.
“What are you doing in a place like this?” he asked.
“...Nothing.” Mahiru was sitting on a bench with straight posture and
didn’t budge at all even after she recognized Amane and looked him over.
In contrast to the first time the two had met there, this time they were
already acquainted and were on speaking terms. That had made it easier for
Amane to call to Mahiru, but the girl’s voice had still been stiff when she
answered. It didn’t seem like Mahiru was on guard, as she had been during
their first encounter. This was something different. Amane could tell that
Mahiru was being careful not to let something show on her face.
“Come on, if it was nothing, you wouldn’t be sitting here making that
face. Did something happen?” Amane inquired.
“...Not really...” Mahiru looked, as she had before when she was on the
swing in the rainstorm, like she was lost and didn’t know what to do. Seeing
her like that worried Amane, but Mahiru didn’t seem keen to speak on the


matter.
Though he was bound by their tacit promise not to interact outside their
apartments, Amane hadn’t been able to help calling out to Mahiru when
he’d seen her all alone in the park again. Mahiru, for her part, probably did
not much want to talk to him; her expression was stiff and blank.
Amane thought it was fine if the girl wasn’t feeling up to talking, when
he noticed that there were a number of white hairs stuck to her blazer. “You
have some hair stuck to your uniform; were you playing with a dog or a
cat?” he asked.
“I wasn’t playing. I just helped a cat that was stranded up a tree get back
down,” Mahiru explained.
“What a total cliché... Ah, I get it now.”
“Hmm?”
“Wait right there. Don’t you dare move.”
Amane had finally realized just why Mahiru was sitting there alone on
the bench. He sighed and dashed off. He was certain that Mahiru would do
as he had asked and would not go anywhere. Actually, it would have been
more appropriate to say that she _couldn’t_ go anywhere.
Muttering to himself about how Mahiru chose the strangest times to act
tough, Amane bought a compress and medical tape from the neighborhood
drugstore, along with a cup of ice normally used for iced coffee from a
convenience store. When Amane at last returned to the park, he found
Mahiru sitting on the bench, just as he’d expected. She hadn’t so much as
shifted.
“Shiina, take off your tights.”
“Huh?”
He gave a direct order, and she answered in an extremely cold voice.
“Yeah, I know it’s kind of sudden... Look, I’ll put my blazer over you
and turn around, so take the tights off. We need to ice the injury and put a
compress on it.”
As expected, Mahiru was none too happy at being ordered to take off her
tights, so by way of explanation, Amane waved the bag full of medical
supplies.
Mahiru’s face understandably tightened. “...How did you know?”
“You had one of your loafers off, and that ankle seemed slightly
swollen. Plus, you didn’t try to stand up. It really is a total cliché to sprain


your ankle while rescuing a cat.”
“Oh, be quiet.”
“Yeah, yeah. Now, take off your tights and give me your foot.”
It was something anyone would have known just from looking, but
Mahiru was making a sour face, perhaps because she hadn’t expected him
to notice that she was hurt. Obediently, Mahiru accepted Amane’s blazer
and put it over her knees, so it seemed like she was going to listen to what
he was saying.
Amane turned his back to Mahiru, put the ice from the cup he had
bought at the convenience store into a plastic bag, and poured water over it.
After he tied the top shut so it wouldn’t spill out, he wrapped it loosely
in a hand towel that he kept in his backpack, making an impromptu ice
pack. Then he turned around slowly.
Mahiru had done as he had asked and removed her tights, exposing her
bare legs. They were slender and smooth—and looked soft even as she
tensed up. The unnatural swelling around her ankle was evident.



“Well, it’s not that badly swollen, but it could get worse if you move it
too much. First of all, this is going to be cold, but let’s ice it for a bit. Once
the pain goes away a little, I’ll put a compress on, so take it easy,” Amane
explained.
“...Thank you.”
“From now on, just ask for my help. It’s not like you’ll owe me or
anything.”
_If anything, it’s the opposite—I want to pay you back in some small way
for everything you’ve done for me, so I’d appreciate if you would let me
solve one or two problems for you._
Mahiru sported her usual expression. Still, she didn’t argue with Amane
and quietly let him ice her ankle while her leg was propped up on the
bench.
“Has the pain gotten any better?” Amane asked after a moment.
“...Yeah, a bit,” Mahiru replied.
“All right, I’m putting the compress on, so...don’t get mad at me for
being a perv or a groper or something, okay?”
“I wouldn’t say something so rude to the person helping me.”
“Good to hear.”
Stressing that he had absolutely no untoward thoughts, Amane squatted
down next to Mahiru’s leg and stuck a compress on her swollen, red ankle.
When Amane initially asked about the level of pain, it sounded like the
sort of thing where Mahiru could still stand and walk, but moving risked
agitating the sprain further, so she was better off sitting here quietly. As
long as she stayed off it, it would probably remain a minor injury.
Amane had just finished sticking on the compress and was securing it
with medical tape when he noticed Mahiru staring intently down at him.
“You’re surprisingly skillful with that,” she commented.
“Well, I can do first aid. Still can’t cook, though.” Amane shrugged,
acting a little silly, and Mahiru let out a small laugh. He was glad to see her
taut expression relax some, even if it was only a tiny bit. Reassured by
Mahiru’s slightly softened attitude, Amane pulled the pants of his gym
uniform from his backpack.
“Here,” he said, handing them to Mahiru.
“What?” she asked.
“Don’t make that face at me; I don’t like it. Anyway, your legs are


exposed, right? And it’s not like you can put your tights back on with the
compress stuck to you. Relax, I haven’t worn them.”
It would be bad to let her put her tights back on over her swollen ankle,
especially now that it had medical tape wrapped around it. Since it looked
so painful, Amane figured Mahiru could wear his gym pants, both as
protection from the cold and to stop anyone from seeing her underwear.
Mahiru seemed to understand that he was just trying to be considerate,
and so she slipped the pants on.
Amane snatched up his blazer and handed Mahiru the parka he’d been
wearing.
“Here, wear this,” he told her.
“Wait, but why?”
“Do you want to be seen being carried?”
Letting Mahiru walk on her ankle was a bad idea. Amane had been
planning to bring her home from the start. They were both headed to the
same place, after all.
“Oh, sorry, but could you put my backpack on?” Amane asked. “I can’t
carry you on my back if I’m wearing it, obviously.”
“Is there an option where you don’t carry me?”
“Look here, your ankle is twisted, so you need to rest it. No one’s
around, and I’ve got perfectly good legs, so please put them to use.”
“Your legs?”
“What, you’d prefer my arms? Would you rather I support you from the
side?”
“Are you even strong enough to carry me all that way?”
“Are you making fun of me? ...Well, I’m actually not that confident.”
Amane knew he could support Mahiru if she leaned on him, but
honestly, it would be quite difficult to fully carry her all the way back to the
apartment complex. What’s more, it would be sure to attract a lot of
attention, which Amane preferred to avoid.
He knew that Mahiru had been poking fun when she’d brought up his
strength, so he smiled, glad she was feeling well enough to crack jokes like
that.
“Look, if you’re game, put the hood up and wear my backpack. After
you get on my back, take your own bag, too, while you’re at it. I won’t be
able to hold it if I’m supporting you,” Amane instructed.


“...Sorry,” Mahiru muttered.
“I’m telling you: It’s fine. It wouldn’t be very manly of me to leave an
injured person behind and go home—or to make you walk.”
Amane crouched down and turned away from her, and Mahiru timidly
leaned onto Amane’s back.
Mahiru was wearing Amane’s parka, so she had on even more clothes
than normal, but even so, he could feel her body pressed against him, slim
and willowy.
After confirming that Mahiru’s arms were secured around his neck
without choking him, Amane stood up slowly, carrying the injured girl on
his back.
_I knew it; she’s so light_ , Amane thought. He wondered if he should be
the one worrying about her diet instead of the other way around. It was
more likely that she was just naturally petite, though; that was probably all
it was.
Mahiru smelled slightly sweet, and though Amane could tell all sorts of
things about how anxious she was feeling based on how tightly she clung to
him, he headed for home without showing it.
A few people did stare at the sight of a guy carrying someone on his
back, but Mahiru had completely covered her face with the hood of his
parka, so Amane wasn’t too worried about what little attention was being
paid to them.
“All right, here we are.” Amane carried Mahiru as far as her front door,
then let her down and quickly turned to leave without interfering any
further.
Since Mahiru could get around on her own while leaning on a wall,
Amane guessed that her injury was probably not all that serious.
Thankfully, it was Friday, so Mahiru had plenty of time to rest her ankle and
get back on her feet with no problems.
“I don’t need dinner tonight, so you should rest. If you like, I could
bring you some nutritional supplements,” Amane offered.
“I’m fine. I have some stuff prepared,” Mahiru answered.
“That’s good. See ya.”
That was the most important thing: that food wouldn’t be a problem. It
was essential that Mahiru be able to keep still and rest. Amane watched her
open the lock on her front door, and he, too, took out his apartment key.


“...Um,” started Mahiru.
“Hmm?”
When Amane heard the girl’s voice and turned around, he saw that she
was looking up at him timidly, clutching her bag to her chest. She looked
somewhat troubled, but as he tilted his head in confusion, she seemed to
regain her resolve and looked straight into his eyes.
“...Thank you for what you did today. You really saved me,” Mahiru
admitted.
“It’s fine, really. I just did it because I wanted to. Take care.”
Embarrassed by the notion of Mahiru fretting over his help, Amane quickly
dismissed the thought from his mind. After Mahiru gave him a quick nod,
Amane turned to unlock his own door. It was only then that Amane realized
that Mahiru was still wearing his parka and athletic pants, but he was sure
she would return them another day, so he slipped into his apartment without
saying anything.

“Damn, dude, you so healthy that you wear shorts year-round now?”
Amane’s melancholy in Monday’s gym class had less to do with his lack
of athletic talent and more to do with the fact that he was wearing knee-
length jersey shorts during an unpleasantly cold season. Everyone else had
already switched to their winter gym uniforms, but Amane stood out from
all the rest, his legs bare below the knee.
“As if. I just forgot my pants.”
“Idiot.”
“Shut up.”
Amane hadn’t seen Mahiru over the weekend, and she still had his gym
pants, but he couldn’t tell Itsuki that, so there was nothing to do but say that
he forgot. He had resigned himself to the inevitable mockery, though when
Itsuki slapped his back, cackling with laughter, Amane still found it in
himself to slap him back.
Amane let out a soft sigh as he watched Itsuki groan quietly. Then his
gaze shifted. At the moment, the boys were practicing their high jumps, and
the girls were using the other side of the field. What’s more, since two
classes of students were using the field at once, it was fairly crowded.
The girls were practicing different track-and-field events, so between


taking turns, the girls had plenty of time to watch Amane’s class.
“Do your best, Kadowaki!”
Usually, the boys and girls took gym class in different places on campus;
with the girls present, the boys were getting all worked up. The girls, on the
other hand, all spent their time watching Amane’s most popular classmate,
the handsome Yuuta Kadowaki.
Amane had never really talked to him before, but he was nice to
everyone and was a great student, and on top of that, he was the ace of the
track club despite being only a first-year. Everyone knew he was popular
with the girls. Amane figured Yuuta must have won some kind of karmic
lottery. A lot of the other boys didn’t care for him as much, and there were
always a lot of sulky looks when he was around.
“Oh wow, looks like Yuuta’s as popular as always,” Itsuki observed.
“Looks that way,” Amane answered dully.
“You don’t seem too interested,” Itsuki prodded.
“Well, it’s not like we’re friends or anything; we’ve barely ever spoken.
So why should I care?”
It wasn’t as though Yuuta was mean or ever messed with Amane. They
had nothing to do with each other, so Amane honestly did not care. He
knew that he was in the minority there, but he couldn’t bring himself to
envy Yuuta the same way all the other boys did. More specifically, Amane
knew that Yuuta was so far out of his league that envying him was
pointless.
“Typical Amane. What, you don’t get jealous now?” Itsuki asked.
“Oh, should I be like ‘Wow, I’m sooo jealous of his populaaarity,’ huh?”
Amane mocked.
“That was pretty good.” Itsuki guffawed.
Amane looked over at Yuuta, who was wearing a brilliant smile and
basking in feminine adoration. Even Amane had to admit that Yuuta’s
athletic body and handsome face made him look just like a prince. In fact,
some girls had taken to calling him that.
Yuuta rewarded the girls’ passionate gazes and shrill voices with another
radiant smile and waved back at them. He really knew how to cultivate a
following.
“Well, he sure is popular, no arguing with that,” admitted Itsuki.
“I know. The other guys can’t contain their jealousy,” Amane said.


“Ha-ha. But the girls are real energetic, too.” Itsuki only had eyes for his
girlfriend, Chitose. He had no interest in other girls, so he saw the Yuuta
issue as everyone else’s problem. Chitose wasn’t the least bit interested in
Yuuta, so Itsuki probably didn’t spend much energy thinking about him.
_We’ve got a prince and an angel... This school has a lot of people with
cringey nicknames.
Come to think of it, I wonder if Mahiru the angel ended up getting
enough rest._ Amane hadn’t seen her leave her apartment over the weekend.
It was good she was resting comfortably, but he still wondered about the
state of her injury.
Amane stealthily scanned the field with his eyes. His class was sharing
the field with Mahiru’s, so she should’ve been there. Without too much
effort, Amane spotted her. Even in a crowd, the angel was easy to pick out.
She hadn’t changed into gym clothes and wasn’t practicing with the rest of
her class. Evidently, she was sitting out today.
Amane was sure that he was not the only boy staring at Mahiru, who sat
there looking small and quiet. Though they were far away from each other,
their eyes met suddenly, and when Amane shifted his gaze around
awkwardly, he saw a small smile pass over Mahiru’s lips. Since she was
looking toward Amane, that meant she was also looking toward the rest of
the boys. Each of Amane’s classmates took the smile for their own, nearly
inciting a riot.
“Did she just smile at me?!”
“No way; must be me!”
“This is our chance! We’ve gotta impress her!”
“The prince is hogging the spotlight.”
To think that Mahiru could cause such excitement with just one meager
smile... Amane didn’t know whether it was because she was that amazing
or because the boys were all that simple.
“...Buncha morons,” Itsuki muttered. He’d apparently been thinking the
same thing.
Amane chuckled. “Well, if we don’t wanna fail gym class, we’d better
get moving, too.”
“What’s that, Amane? The angel’s heavenly gaze got you all riled up,
too?”
“No, nothing like that. I told you, I’m not interested.”


“Well, guess I’ll drop it, then. Since you don’t care and all.”
Itsuki seemed like he was about to start boasting about how great
girlfriends are, likely citing his own personal experience, but Amane was
quick to brush him off. “Yeah, yeah,” he said. He spared one more glance in
Mahiru’s direction and smiled wryly.

“Thank you for what you did the other day. Here’s your parka and
sweatpants back.”
That evening, when Mahiru brought him his portion of dinner, she was
carrying a paper bag in addition to the plastic container. Amane could see at
a glance that the parka and pants he had loaned her a few days ago were
folded neatly in the bag.
“Mm. How’s the ankle?” he asked.
“The pain is already mostly gone. I’ve decided not to do any exercise
until it’s completely healed,” Mahiru replied.
“That’s for the best. Looks like you’re sitting out gym class, too.”
“Yeah.”
Mahiru had decided to play it safe and not participate in gym, and
Amane figured it was probably the right thing to do. Her ankle didn’t look
like it was hurting her anymore, but she still slightly favored that leg when
she walked, indicating that it was not yet entirely healed.
As Amane was nodding at the girl’s sensible decision, he thought back
on the day’s gym class and smiled suddenly. “You know, you’re really
amazing, Miss Angel. With a single smile, all the boys were practically
bursting with excitement.”
“I told you to stop calling me that... And it’s not as if I like that kind of
attention. It really bothers me, you know,” Mahiru said.
“Well, who wouldn’t get fired up when a beautiful person looks at them?
You know, the girls started shrieking today, too, when Kadowaki waved at
them.”
“...Kadowaki...oh, that super-popular guy?” Mahiru didn’t seem to be
too interested in the prince. Actually, it seemed like she didn’t even
recognize his name. Amane had to describe him a bit before Mahiru
realized who he was talking about.
Yuuta wasn’t as popular as the angel, but he was a fairly well-known


boy in their grade, so Amane was surprised that she didn’t know who he
was.
“You’re not interested in him?” Amane asked.
“Not particularly. We’re in different classes, and we’ve never really
spoken,” Mahiru replied.
“Hmm. The other girls go bananas for him, though. They can’t get
enough of the cool dude.”
“Well, he does have a handsome face. But we don’t talk; we don’t have
any connection. So I don’t really care.”
“You’re so candid about things like that,” Amane observed.
“Well, if looks are so important, don’t you think it’s strange that you
don’t like me?” asked Mahiru.
“Oh, so you do realize how beautiful you are?”
Mahiru was quite right in what she said. Beauty could be the spark that
ignited greater affections, but it was rarely the sole source of love. Amane
agreed with that, just as he agreed that Mahiru was very pretty. It was
certainly a surprise to hear her say that herself, though.
“I know that, objectively speaking, I’m considered very attractive, and I
do work hard to maintain my appearance. It’s only natural. Given how often
people make a big deal about my looks, I can tell what they think of me
even if I don’t want to know.” Mahiru didn’t seem to be boasting in the
least.
She was certainly being honest about how much effort she spent on her
appearance. Mahiru had always had a good-looking face, but clearly she
was not content to coast by on natural good looks. Her hair was like a
radiant halo, befitting her angelic nickname, and the luster of her skin was
also always perfect, without a single blemish. Her hands didn’t get chapped,
even when she was doing housework, and even her fingernails were
beautifully polished. The gentle curves of her body spoke to a well-
balanced figure that had likely taken some effort to cultivate.
“I’m going to say something straight up, so don’t get mad at me...,”
Amane began, “but...you don’t seem to be embarrassed by all this praise.”
“I’d get annoyed before I’d get embarrassed if someone wouldn’t stop
flattering me,” Mahiru answered curtly.
“Guess being beautiful has its own struggles.”
“Still, beauty does have its advantages, so I suppose I shouldn’t


complain.”
“You say that like you wouldn’t know...”
“What? Would you rather I bashfully say ‘Oh, no, that’s not true!’?”
“No, as someone who knows what you’re really like, that would be
weird.”
“Exactly. Honestly, I don’t see the point in putting on an act like that in
front of you.”
“Glad to hear it.”
Mahiru had only recently dropped her public persona around Amane, so
if she changed back now... Amane could feel goosebumps prickling at the
thought of facing the distant angel he saw at school rather than the girl he
was gradually getting to know.
In the end, things between the two of them remained as they were.
Amane looked at the food container he’d been handed. There was
actually more food than usual. The container was packed with several side
dishes, each one a large portion. Rather than leftovers, it was more like
Amane had been handed a fancy boxed lunch.
“Today’s quite the smorgasbord,” he said.
“Because you took such good care of me,” Mahiru replied.
“I told you not to worry about that... Oh, there are croquettes in here!”
Amane could never say no to croquettes.
Croquettes were frequently sold à la carte but could be a big pain to
make yourself. As such, you could consider them the pinnacle of home
cooking. After steaming potatoes, mashing them, stirring in sautéed beef,
onions, and more, and then forming the patties, you had to completely chill
them, then add batter and fry them. It was a very involved process. Even
Amane, who rarely cooked anything, had watched his mother make
croquettes and had decided never to make them himself because they were
such a pain.
“Well, I had them already made and chilling, so I only had to fry them,”
Mahiru explained.
“Is that why there’s fried chicken, too?” asked Amane.
“That’s right.”
Living alone, Amane didn’t get to eat a lot of fried dishes, so he was
grateful for the handmade food. Of course, they were best when they were
freshly made, while the coating was still nice and crispy, served with hot


rice.
“...Sometime, I’d like to try them straight out of the oil,” Amane
muttered.
Mahiru had packed the fried chicken into the container after letting it
cool, perhaps for hygienic reasons. So no matter what, Amane would need
to warm the food back up. Though fried foods could be restored to a crispy
texture via a toaster oven, it still wasn’t the same as eating the stuff fresh.
Amane had no doubts that Mahiru’s cooking would still be delicious, of
course, but it would probably be even better right from the pan.
Amane hadn’t meant to whisper what he had been thinking; his desire
had simply leaked from his lips. Unfortunately, he’d said it loud enough
that Mahiru raised her eyebrows a little.
“Are you inviting me over?” she asked.
“That’s not what I’m saying at all! It’s already too presumptuous of me
to share your meals.” Amane hadn’t meant it that way at all, and he
shrugged and vehemently denied it.
Mahiru brought a hand to her mouth and directed her gaze downward.
She seemed to be mulling something over and did not make eye contact
with Amane.
“...Your share,” she finally said.
“Huh?”
“Let me cook at your place, and we can consider that as part of paying
for your share of the food expenses.”
Mahiru’s sudden proposition left Amane’s mouth hanging open in
shock.
The accidental mention about eating the fried foods fresh had been more
of a sardonic wish than anything else. That Mahiru had actually considered
and agreed to it left Amane completely bewildered.
Normally, who would think of going into the home of some boy they
didn’t know all that well to cook dinner? Maybe it would be more efficient
to cook at his place rather than bring the food over after, but he was a
member of the opposite sex, and it wasn’t like they were close friends.
Wouldn’t doing that make Mahiru uneasy?
“You definitely don’t need to do that; I’ve already received way more
than I could ask for, way more than I deserve... Aren’t you worried about
your safety?”


“If you try anything, I’ll crush you. Hard. No mercy.”
“Ack, you’re scary! I felt a chill.”
“Well, I don’t suppose it will come to that. You already know what the
risks are, and I’ve decided you won’t do anything. You know how popular I
am at school, right?”
“Even supposing I did try something, it’d be the end of me.”
Mahiru was vastly more popular than Amane, and on top of that,
everyone saw her as this delicate girl, so if word got around that Amane had
so much as thought about doing anything inappropriate to her, he was sure
he’d never be able to set foot on school grounds again. Amane was not so
foolish or so unprincipled as to try something knowing that it would mean,
at best, social ruin. He wasn’t interested anyway.
“Besides...,” Mahiru added.
“Besides?” Amane asked, urging her to continue.
“You’re not even the right type for someone like me,” Mahiru asserted
with a straight face, then suddenly smiled.
“And what if I was your type?” Amane pressed.
“First of all, I believe you were the one who insisted on talking to me.
And then wanted nothing to do with me.”
“And that won you over?” Amane asked.
“I mean, it told me that you’re harmless enough,” Mahiru explained.
“Uh, thanks, I guess.”
Whether that was a good thing or not, Amane couldn’t deny it was true.
After all, he had never had any intention of doing anything with Mahiru in
the first place. One thing was certain, however: Amane was not going to
pass up the chance to enjoy a freshly made meal. He accepted the title of
harmless guy and gained the privilege of sharing dinner.


Mahiru was going to start cooking dinner at Amane’s apartment, and she
presented him with a list of conditions:

- Amane would pay for half the cost of ingredients, plus an additional
    labor cost, plus the cost of any incidental expenses.
- The two of them would each contact the other no later than the day
    before if they had something to do and couldn’t eat together.
- They would divide the work of shopping and cleaning up afterward.
Regarding the extra labor cost, it had taken some work to get Mahiru to
agree to it. Amane had insisted that he felt bad about all the time she was
spending on him. It was to be expected, since she did all the work making
the food. Aside from that, though, Amane and Mahiru had come to an
agreement rather quickly.
And so, the day after their agreement had been ratified, Mahiru came
over early holding supermarket bags in both hands and made preparations
to start cooking.
“...It’s really all brand-new, like it’s hardly been used...,” Mahiru
commented.
“Shut up,” Amane shot back.
A beautiful girl stood in his kitchen, and she was wearing an apron. This
was like a fantasy come to life. Amane was sure he was going to lose it any
second now. When Mahiru pointed out, yet again, that he had really never
used his kitchen, he felt a deep shame.
“You’ve got an impressive collection of gadgets here, but they’re like


pearls tossed before swine,” Mahiru observed.
“Well, if you use them, they won’t go to waste,” Amane reasoned.
“That’s a poor excuse, after the fact. Your precious cookware is
practically dying from neglect.”
“All right then, bring it back to life with your amazing culinary talents. I
sure as hell can’t.”
With gracious concession, Amane motioned for Mahiru to take over. She
returned the gesture with an exasperated expression, but perhaps because
she’d expected as much, she just sighed and didn’t complain further.
“All right, let’s get started. Do you have any spices?”
“Of course I do; are you making fun of me? They’re all properly stored
—and none are expired, either.”
“Wow, I’m surprised.”
“It’s because they’ve never been opened.”
“That’s nothing to brag about. All right, if you don’t have what we need,
I can bring things over from my place to use this once.”
“That would be helpful.”
“For now, if you have the basics, I think we can make do. Also, I
decided on today’s dishes already; is that all right?”
“I don’t know much about cooking, so I’m happy with anything as long
as I get to eat. I don’t have strong preferences.”
“Really? Then let’s hurry up and get started... Please show me where
you keep everything.”
“In this basket.”
“They’re really unopened, huh...”
Mahiru raised her eyebrows in shock as she stared at the basket filled
with untouched seasonings. Perhaps because she’d been warned before
she’d seen the unused spices, she quickly reassumed her usual demeanor
and began washing her hands at the sink.
“All right, I’m going to start making stuff, so you can go wait in the
living room or in your bedroom,” Mahiru declared.
“Okay. I can’t help you with anything anyway,” Amane accepted.
“What a gentleman. I suppose you’d just get in the way if you hung
around.”
“You’re awfully honest.”
“It’s just the truth. There’s no need to sugarcoat it.”


As Mahiru said, he would clearly just be in the way, so Amane
obediently returned to the living room and watched her back as she worked.
When she had finished washing her hands, Mahiru quickly set to work.
Amane didn’t know what she was making, but based on the ingredients she
had readied, it was probably Japanese food.
Everything about this felt strange to Amane, like he was in a dream, but
it was real. Mahiru was actually preparing the ingredients right there, her
hair tied up in a gently swaying ponytail.
_What’s with this situation? It’s like I’ve got a wife or something_ , Amane
thought.
Mahiru probably didn’t feel the same way, but their setup looked a little
too much like they were a happy family, and Amane couldn’t help but
imagine it. He didn’t have even the smallest desire to live with Mahiru, but
the sight of a beautiful girl standing in his kitchen was in itself enough to
send his mind to all sorts of places. Whether or not there was any affection
between Amane and Mahiru, just having a lovely girl treat him to a home-
cooked meal was enough to touch Amane’s heart.
“...Are you thinking weird things over there?”
“You can stop with the strange speculations.”
Amane had frozen when Mahiru called him out. She’d guessed what he
was thinking without even turning around.
_She sure is sharp..._
Feeling amazed and anxious all at once, Amane stamped down on the
not-quite-evil base instincts that had begun welling up inside him and
returned to staring at Mahiru’s back.

About an hour later, Mahiru began setting out completed dishes on the
table.
She’d chosen to make Japanese food today, which was typical when one
considered her penchant for healthy cooking.
“It turns out you have quite a few utensils and seasonings, so it looks
like I won’t have to bring anything from my place. Starting tomorrow, I can
try more elaborate dishes, too.”
“I mean, I’m just grateful you’re making anything for me,” Amane
admitted.


Perhaps because Mahiru hadn’t known how many pieces of cookware
and seasonings Amane had in his collection, she had made many simple
dishes rather than anything more intricate, but the presentation was flawless
nonetheless.
Lined up along the table was an array of Japanese-style dishes. From
fish simmered in soy sauce to dressed greens. From rolled omelets to miso
soup. Every last item was something Amane could never dream of making
himself.



Previously, Amane had said he didn’t have any particular likes or
dislikes, but he did in fact love Japanese food. He wanted to reassure
Mahiru, who looked apologetic for having only prepared easy recipes, that
this was exactly what he had wanted.
“...It looks amazing,” Amane said.
“I’m happy to hear you say that. Eat up while it’s still hot.”
Mahiru sat down in a chair next to her, so Amane took a seat across the
table.
His dining table was small, since he lived alone, so no matter how they
sat, they were still close together. It was lucky that Amane happened to
have two chairs just in case a guest stopped by, but seeing a beautiful girl
sitting right before his eyes evoked some indescribable feeling from within
him.
Once Amane set upon the food, however, even Mahiru’s beauty ceased
to matter.
Hurriedly, he said “Let’s eat” and started with the miso soup.
The moment he brought the bowl to his lips and took a sip, the fragrant
miso and the flavor of the dashi spread through his mouth. The gentle taste
was so completely different from instant miso soup. Amane could tell that it
must have been prepared with great care. The miso flavor wasn’t
overpowering, and it was thoughtfully seasoned to allow the taste of the
dashi broth to come through.
At first, Amane felt that the soup’s taste was just a little bit strong, but
after he considered drinking it while eating the other dishes, he realized that
it struck the perfect balance and knew he would empty his bowl. Rather
than being overwhelming, the miso soup was a comforting flavor. It was a
taste that made you want to eat more.
“Delicious,” Amane said with sincerity.
“Thank you for saying so.” Mahiru’s eyes crinkled in a relieved smile.
Amane had been complimenting Mahiru’s cooking for a while, but she’d
probably been feeling nervous with this being the first time she’d cooked
right in front of him.
Mahiru watched Amane for a few moments before eating anything
herself. Once she finally did start digging in, Amane extended his
chopsticks toward the other dishes.
Sampling a bit of each dish, it came as no surprise to Amane that


everything Mahiru had prepared was fantastic.
The simmered fish was bursting with juicy flavor without sacrificing its
tenderness.
Usually when fish was cooked for a long time to bring out the taste, it
would naturally lose some moisture and dry out, but this one was plump
and had a nice texture.
As for the rolled omelets, they were tailored exactly to Amane’s tastes.
They were an enticingly vivid yellow, and when Amane stuffed one in his
mouth, he was unsurprised by the gentle seasoning of dashi that greeted
him.
When it came to Japanese-style omelets, Amane knew, some people
added sugar when making them, while others only used salt. These rolled
ones had been flavored with dashi, however. In addition to the rich taste of
the dashi, Amane could also taste a faint sweetness. He wondered if that
light undertone came from honey. There probably wasn’t that much in the
rolled omelets, but the satisfying hint of sweetness brought out a real depth.
Amane had no real preference between sweet or salty when it came to
egg dishes, but the ones he liked best combined the complex flavor of dashi
with what he suspected was a bit of honey. Mahiru had accomplished that
expertly, and Amane found himself quite impressed.
Quietly muttering that the rolled omelets were delicious, Amane
grabbed another one with his chopsticks and quickly tossed it in his mouth.
Not only had they been perfectly flavored, they’d been skillfully cooked
as well. The stock added to the eggs made them extra juicy.
_These are definitely better than Mom’s rolled omelets._ He kept rude
thoughts about his nonpresent mother to himself as he smacked his lips
happily. Then he realized that Mahiru was staring at him.
“...You really seem to be enjoying it.”
“Because it’s all so good. I’m paying my respects to the delicious food.”
“Sure, all right.”
“Besides, doesn’t it feel better when I’m honest about how much I enjoy
it rather than sitting here eating with a blank expression?”
_If you think something’s delicious, you’ve got to really act like it,
otherwise, the person who made it will be left wondering. Even if you say
you enjoy it, who would believe you if you didn’t look the part? It’s better to
be honest and just let how you feel show directly on your face. Whether_


_you’re the one giving thanks or being thanked, it’s best to do what feels
good._
“...Yes, I suppose so...” Mahiru seemed to understand what Amane was
saying, and she smiled slightly. It was a gentle expression, and it betrayed
just a hint of relief. It was sweet enough that all of Amane’s thoughts
ground to a halt for a second.
“...Fujimiya?” Mahiru asked.
“Ah...no, it’s nothing,” Amane replied. He’d been enchanted by the
angel’s smile, but he couldn’t possibly tell her that. To conceal his growing
embarrassment, Amane took another bite of food, ending any further
discussion.

“...Thank you for dinner.”
“I’m glad you liked it.”
Amane had completely devoured every dish Mahiru had laid out.
Mahiru’s words had been calm, but her expression was serene, and she
seemed happy that Amane had packed everything into his stomach. Not a
single grain of rice had been left behind.
“It was delicious,” Amane complimented.
“I could tell that much just by watching you,” Mahiru quipped dryly.
“Better than my mom’s cooking.”
“I hear it’s taboo to compare a girl’s cooking to your mother’s.”
“Isn’t that only true when you’re criticizing someone? Anyway, does
that bother you?”
“I don’t mind, no.”
“Well then, it’s fine, right? It doesn’t change the fact that it’s delicious.”
Mahiru was clearly no amateur cook. Amane’s mother probably had
more years of experience under her belt, but she preferred different tastes,
and many of her dishes were fairly bland, so they were no match for
Mahiru’s carefully concocted foods.
“...Man, this is so awesome. To be able to eat like that every night!”
exclaimed Amane.
“As long as I don’t have anything else going on, that is,” Mahiru added.
“...So I can really host you every night for dinner?”
“I wouldn’t have suggested it if I was against the idea.”


“Well, I guess that’s true.”
Mahiru was a straight shooter, so of course she would’ve never agreed to
it if she didn’t want to in the first place. Amane still wasn’t sure if it was
okay to have her cooking for him like this so often, however.
He was paying for half the ingredients, plus a bit extra to cover her
labor, but even so, he couldn’t help feeling like the burden on Mahiru was
too large.
“...Do you normally cook for boys you don’t even like?” Amane asked.
“I’m doing it because you were neglecting your health. Besides, I enjoy
the act of cooking itself, and I don’t hate seeing you eat it with such gusto.”
“But...,” Amane started.
“If it bothers you that much, it would be no problem to stop.”
“No, please, I’m begging you.”
At the first sign of Mahiru possibly not cooking for him anymore,
Amane instantly retracted any and all complaints. That was just how much
her food meant to him. To have it snatched away now—it would practically
be a matter of life and death.
Amane was entirely aware that Mahiru had gained full control of him by
way of his stomach, but Mahiru’s cooking was just too delicious to refuse.
Returning to convenience-store meals now would be like robbing the world
of color.
Shocked at Amane’s immediate reply, Mahiru was stunned for a moment
before breaking into a smile.
“Well then, please continue to enjoy.”
“...Okay.”
It appeared that Amane’s days of dining with the extremely charitable
angel who made all the food by hand would continue for a while yet.
Amane couldn’t help but sigh from happiness, guilt, and anticipation.


“Amaneee, how’d you do?”
Semester exams had finally ended. Having survived their collective hell,
the students gathered in their classroom, more exited and animated than
usual.
Amane and Itsuki, both relieved that they had wrapped up all their tests,
were comparing their performances.
“Mm? Oh, pretty average,” Amane answered. “Not that great, not that
bad.”
The exam had covered the expected material, so for anyone who studied
daily, it wasn’t that difficult. Amane had done about as well this time as he
had with other tests, leaving little to say about his academics one way or the
other.
Amane got bored easily, but he nevertheless always made sure to study.
He was able to retain most of the things taught in class, but it was far too
difficult to get a perfect score, so his scores usually floated between a solid
eighty and ninety.
“I bet you’ll make it into the top thirty, if you didn’t outdo yourself...
you egghead,” Itsuki teased.
“It’s because I study every day,” Amane shot back.
“Well, how nice for you!”
“Don’t start; you’re the one forgetting to study ’cause you’re too busy
flirting.”
The difference between Amane and Itsuki probably had less to do with
their intellectual capacities and more to do with which one of them spent all


their free time with a certain girlfriend named Chitose. Itsuki had the ability
to make it into a pretty high score bracket if he ever bothered to study
seriously, but since Chitose was his real priority, his actual rank was much
lower than Amane’s.
“...Girlfriends are great, you know?” Itsuki said wistfully.
“Yeah, yeah.”
“Hey, Amane, you should get a girlfriend, too!”
“If guys could just get girlfriends whenever they wanted, the men of the
world wouldn’t shed so many bitter tears.”
There were plenty of unsatisfied men who would have taken offense at
Itsuki’s thoughtless remark. Amane, though, wasn’t really inclined to get
angry with him over it. In fact, he’d never really felt that way about any
girl, so he was content to let the comment pass.
“Assuming I did get one, what then?” Amane inquired.
“A double date,” Itsuki replied.
“That would end in a bad case of heartburn for my fictional girlfriend
and me. We’d have to break up.”
“You could flirt in front of us, too, y’know!”
“Do you really think I can find a girlfriend, the way I live?”
“...I guess it’s impossible.”
“Right?”
Amane was honest to a fault, even with himself. He’d always found
other people difficult and exhausting, and he was aware that many people
found him to be standoffish. That, plus the blunt way he spoke, meant he
was not all that popular. Amane’s social status would’ve made it hard to
find a girlfriend, even if he was looking for one.
Against all odds, if Amane did somehow find a girlfriend, he was sure
they wouldn’t be like Itsuki and Chitose. He couldn’t picture himself
flirting in public with a girl, oblivious to anyone who might see.
“Come on, you should at least find someone you like, Amane. If you
just cut your bangs a little shorter, cleaned yourself up, and maybe found a
style that worked for you, the girls would definitely look at you differently,
I’m tellin’ ya.”
Assuming Amane’s self-evaluation was accurate, he didn’t have the
handsome looks of a pretty boy like Yuuta or a Romeo like Itsuki, but he
definitely didn’t think he was ugly, either. Amane figured that if he just


spent more time on his grooming and paid more attention to his clothes, he
could rival most of the other boys his age. The problem was that he didn’t
know enough about fashion to dress well, and he was certainly not smooth
enough with his words to win any girl over.
“I’m not interested in the kind of girl who picks a date based on
appearance,” Amane asserted.
“You say that, but if you don’t get them interested in the first place, you
won’t even get to know them well enough to judge their personality, right?”
Itsuki argued back.
“...Even if that’s true, I’m not really looking for a girlfriend right now.”
Were some hypothetical girl ever actually interested in Amane, it would
be all over the second she saw how he lived. Amane was a slob with no life
skills, and on top of that, he had a difficult time getting along with other
people. If there was a girl who was drawn to him, despite all that, he’d like
to meet her. Such a hopeless thought was enough to bring a bitter smile to
Amane’s face.
Besides, since Mahiru was cooking dinners for him now, a girlfriend
could introduce some unpleasant complications. Not that Amane intended
to pursue a relationship in the first place, but that was simply one more
strike against the idea.
Amane felt that Mahiru’s delicious cooking was worth more than the
possibility of an as-yet-unseen girlfriend, and that conviction was not likely
to be easily overturned.
“Ugh, you’re so boring... How about I get Chi to introduce you to one
of her friends?” offered Itsuki.
“You care way too much about this. Most of Chi’s friends are too...
excitable. It’s hard for me to hang out with them, even as friends.” Amane
quickly shot down the idea.
“Only because you’re so gloomy.”
“Oh, shut up.”
“Well, if you say so, I won’t say anything to her for now. But as a
blossoming high school boy, isn’t it sad to live an empty life, all by
yourself?”
“I don’t need a girlfriend; they’re too much trouble.”
_Just what do you think we’re supposed to be doing at school anyway?_
Amane thought. Even if he wasn’t actually that serious about his studies, he


still didn’t see the point in spending so much time worrying about romance.
Above all, finding a real match was no easy feat.
“...What a waste,” Itsuki grumbled.
“Yeah, yeah.” Amane shrugged.
“But listen, you’ll change your tune when you find a good one, Amane,
ya hear?”
“What makes you so sure?”
“Because girls particularly like to fuss over guys like you.”
“Whatever you say, man.”
Amane couldn’t imagine acting so sentimental; it didn’t seem possible.
He decided to simply ignore his friend’s words. Itsuki was looking at
Amane with an exasperated glare, when suddenly, his line of sight shifted,
and his face relaxed.
“Itsukiii! Let’s go home together!”
“Ah, Chi!”
Just then, Chitose appeared. Apparently, Itsuki had promised to walk her
home, which brought a swift end to their conversation.
When Amane turned to see where his friend’s attention had shifted, he
saw a girl with medium-short light-brown hair tinged with red, looking their
way with a radiant smile. Well, to be more accurate, she was only looking
and waving at Itsuki.
The girl’s lively aura and bright, smiling face were enough to make
Itsuki beam whenever he saw her. That was the kind of effect Chitose had
on people, and for better or worse, she was always the center of attention.
Chitose was a different type of beauty than Mahiru. She had a great big
smile as she rushed over. With any luck, she wouldn’t have much to say
today, because usually whenever Chitose talked, she made fun of Amane.
“You agree, right, Chi? Amane’s the type of guy who needs a girlfriend
to take care of him, don’t you think?” Itsuki asked.
“Don’t stick your nose where it doesn’t belong,” chided Amane.
“Wait, what, do you have a girlfriend, Amane?!” Chitose exclaimed
excitedly.
“No way.”
“Aw, bummer,” Chitose said, pouting. “If you did, I’d want to be friends
with her.”
“Knowing your idea of friendship, I would feel bad for my imaginary


girlfriend,” Amane said.
“Oh, so you have an _imaginary_ girlfriend?” Chitose asked.
“Weren’t we just talking about _what if_ I had one?!”
“Kidding, kidding.”
“I get tired just talking to you...”
“That’s just because you don’t have the stamina to handle me.”
“Don’t have the patience, more like...”
Even a short exchange with Chitose was mentally exhausting for
Amane. Most of the time, he tried to keep his head down and avoid other
people, like at school. When he found himself forced to carry on a
conversation with someone as extroverted as Chitose, it was really
demanding.
Chitose didn’t let Amane’s sour attitude bother her at all and flashed the
exhausted-looking boy a truly joyful-looking smile. “You’re such a mess.”
Itsuki smiled in the same way and tossed out some perfunctory advice.
“You’d better get your act together, buddy.”
Amane was already too worn-out, managing only to let out a deep sigh.

“...What are you doing?”
After returning home and gobbling up Mahiru’s handmade food, Amane
returned to the living room once he was finished doing the dishes and saw
Mahiru with a question sheet spread out before her.
There’d been no agreement about cleaning the dishes, but Amane took
the initiative to shoulder the burden whenever possible. While he’d been
tidying up, Mahiru had gone to sit in the living room. It would have been
inexcusable to make her do everything and then hurry on home.
“I’m grading,” Mahiru answered.
“I mean, I can see that.”
She seemed to be reviewing her answers with her textbook out, checking
that she hadn’t gotten anything wrong.
“So what’s the result?” Amane asked.
“Well, if I didn’t make any recording errors on my answer sheet, then
it’s...a perfect score.”
“I can’t think of anything to say except ‘It figures.’”
Just as Mahiru didn’t show much of a reaction in regard to her errorless


work, Amane didn’t have a very exaggerated response. He wasn’t surprised,
because her name was practically always written in the top spot of the
periodic exam results. He knew Mahiru was more than capable of a perfect
score, so he was not the least bit surprised by her performance here.
“It’s because studying doesn’t bother me. I’ve actually already
completed all of this year’s coursework, so now it’s enough to simply
review,” Mahiru explained.
“Whoa, you really go all out...,” Amane replied.
“You study a lot yourself, Fujimiya.”
“You know what my grades are like?”
“I sort of remember your name in the ranking list.”
Apparently, Mahiru had known a little bit about Amane before they ever
spoke. She must have noticed him among the top ranks, because she
recounted his exact placement on the most recent test without hesitation,
almost like she was looking at the list right now.
Amane did work pretty hard at his studies, but it wasn’t because of some
earnest drive for success or anything. It was because of an agreement he’d
come to with his parents. In order to live alone, he had to maintain good
grades.
“Well, it’s a condition for my current lifestyle: I have to keep my grades
up.”
The only other facet to the agreement was that Amane had to visit home
at least once every six months, but he could take care of that over long
school breaks. Basically, as long as he was keeping his grades up, there
were no problems.
“I study hard enough to keep my head above water, but nothing like you.
You really put a lot of effort in.”
“...I have to try hard,” Mahiru mumbled, casting her eyes downward.
Her expression was hidden by her bangs, and while Amane couldn’t get a
proper look at it, anyone would have recognized it wasn’t a happy one.
Before he could get a read on her, though, she quickly looked back up, once
again wearing her usual expression.
Even if there had been time to point out the curious change, Amane
probably wouldn’t have. He could tell that Mahiru was carrying some kind
of painful burden by certain things she did or faces she made.
While Amane made sure to never ask Mahiru what was bothering her or


what was so unpleasant, he still got the impression that she was struggling
with something. Amane imagined that, whatever it was, it had its origins in
her home life. It was hardly the kind of subject he could just casually
broach with the girl. He understood that this was not an area in which an
outsider like himself could intrude, and so Amane never touched the
subject, and he persistently tried to maintain a sense of distance appropriate
for a neighbor.
Everyone had things they didn’t want to talk about, even Amane.
Treading thoughtlessly on Mahiru would be rude, and he was sure that she
appreciated the fact that he pretended not to notice her distress.
Having disguised her abrupt change in mood, Mahiru declared in a clear
voice that she would be heading back to her own apartment. She put her
textbook and her answer sheet back into her bag.
Amane didn’t have any intention of stopping her, so he replied simply
“Mm-hmm, sounds good” and watched Mahiru get ready to leave.
When the angel had finished putting everything away, she stood up from
her seat, and Amane noticed that she’d left something behind next to her
empty cup. He picked it up and discovered it was a case holding Mahiru’s
student ID, the kind any student would have. She’d probably pulled it out
along with her textbook and forgotten to put it away.
Along with her name and picture, the little plastic card displayed
common information, like her student number, birthday, and blood type.
After staring at it for a second, Amane called out to Mahiru, who was in the
entryway and putting her shoes on.
“You forgot this,” he said.
“Oh, sorry for the trouble. Well then, good night.”
“Night.”
Mahiru gave a quick, polite bow and turned her back on Amane’s
apartment. With a small sigh, Amane watched her leave.
Thinking back to the birth date listed on Mahiru’s school ID, Amane put
a hand to his forehead as he realized something.
“...That’s in four days, isn’t it?”
If he hadn’t unintentionally seen the girl’s ID, he likely never would’ve
found out. Amane wished that he’d known about Mahiru’s birthday a little
earlier and let out another sigh, a deep one.


“Hey, I was wondering, is there anything you want?”
The following day, Amane tried to see if there was anything Mahiru
might like as a gift.
There was no ulterior motive behind the gesture. In fact, Amane had
been thinking for a while that it might be nice to get something for the girl
who had been taking care of him every day. A birthday seemed like the
perfect time.
There must have been something odd about the way Amane phrased the
question, however, because Mahiru gave him a puzzled look. One that made
Amane begin to regret asking such a direct question.
“Why are you asking all of the sudden?” Mahiru inquired.
“You don’t seem very materialistic, so I was just curious.”
“Out of nowhere again...”
Amane thought that he should probably have tried to play it a little
smoother, but it was too late for that now. The one possible saving grace
was that Mahiru didn’t seem to have realized that this was about her
birthday. As far as she knew, Amane should’ve had no way of knowing her
date of birth. Hopefully, that would keep her from catching on.
“Well, let’s see, there is one thing I need. I guess that’s what I want right
now.”
“What do you want?”
“A whetstone.”
“A...whetstone?”
Unconsciously, Amane repeated Mahiru’s words, because the girl’s
answer had been far too unexpected.
_No one could’ve expected that kind of answer from a high school girl.
Normally, you’d think they would want cosmetics, or accessories, or bags,
or something like that_ , Amane thought. He would never in his wildest
dreams have expected a girl to want a tool for sharpening metal.
“That’s right, a whetstone. I already have several, but I want one with a
finer finishing surface, you see,” Mahiru explained.
“Are you sure you’re really an ordinary high school girl?” Amane asked.
“Please don’t expect me to be ordinary.”
It was difficult for Amane to object to that. Mahiru could not be called
an ordinary high schooler, by any standard. Describing her as an angel
seemed entirely accurate. Mahiru was a prodigy who was good at school


and sports. What’s more, she was an excellent cook and a skilled
housekeeper. As if that wasn’t enough, Mahiru was a noble young lady who
spent so much time taking care of a slob like Amane that she could’ve been
mistaken for a married woman.
_Still, who could have imagined she’d want something like a whetstone?_
Mahiru had to be the only high school girl in the whole world who
wanted such a thing.
“You can’t buy it yourself?” Amane wondered aloud. She was well-off,
after all.
“It’s not exactly that I can’t buy it, you know. It’s just—I won’t have that
many opportunities to use it, and it’s pretty expensive. After considering all
that, I couldn’t really justify the purchase. I already have one that can put a
decent edge on, so I keep telling myself that I don’t really need it.”
Amane had to admit that it was more than a bit frightening to know that
Mahiru owned several whetstones already.
“...How many high school girls out there sharpen their own kitchen
knives?” he asked.
“Quite a few,” Mahiru replied.
“Even if there are, you’re the only one I know, and you’re also the only
one who wants another whetstone.”
“Well, I suppose it’s nice to be unique.”
“If you say so...”
This certainly was an angel with unusual interests. Amane couldn’t
make heads or tails of her.
Mahiru tilted her head in confusion as Amane stood there looking
baffled. He’d completely lost sight of his original objective.

“Hey, Itsuki?”
After completely failing to decide on a gift that Mahiru might
appreciate, Amane had decided instead to consult with his best friend. Itsuki
had a way with women’s hearts, as well as a girlfriend to consult, so Amane
expected that he would probably have some grasp on what a girl would
normally want. While he wasn’t really sure it was a good idea to try to
apply normal standards to someone like Mahiru, he expected that she
wouldn’t outright hate things that made someone else’s girlfriend happy.


“What’s up?” Itsuki replied.
“When you give Chitose presents, what do you usually get her?”
Amane thought it would be best to start by asking what Itsuki bought for
his girl, but all he got back was a blank stare.
“Huh, you planning on giving a present to some sweetheart of yours?”
“Do you think I have it in me to do something like that?”
“Nope.”
“All right, then.”
“In that case, why are you asking?”
“Someone I know has a birthday coming up, so I wanted to ask you.”
While Amane was planning on listening to Itsuki’s advice with the
utmost attention, he was also keen not to reveal too much about his own
circumstances.
“Hmm...for starters, you should try finding out what they want. You
know, it’s important to do that sort of research on a regular basis. It’s the
secret to a harmonious relationship, I’m telling you,” said Itsuki.
“I told you that this isn’t for a girlfriend,” Amane reminded.
Setting aside the potential grave danger the other boys at school would
pose to Amane’s physical safety if word ever got around, Mahiru was too
awe-inspiring to even consider asking out in the first place.
Sure, he was comfortable hanging around with her, and they got along
well enough as two frank individuals, but there were absolutely no romantic
feelings between them. Sure, she was cute, but that didn’t mean Amane
wanted a relationship.
“What they want, huh...? And what if you don’t know?” Amane asked.
“Depends on how close you are. If you’re good friends, an accessory or
something is good, but if you’re not close, something practical that they can
use is a safer bet. There are lots of girls who’re happy to get flowers but
don’t know what to do when they receive them,” Itsuki explained.
“...You sure know your stuff.”
“Well, I’ve done a fair bit of research, I guess.”
Itsuki and Chitose hadn’t always been so wild about each other. Their
relationship had slowly developed, first starting in middle school. Amane
had gone to a different middle school, so he didn’t really know all the
details, but apparently, they’d gone through a lot together, and their
relationship had grown from those experiences to the point where these


days, they wouldn’t shut up about each other.
To hear him tell it, Itsuki had also been fairly lost the first time he’d had
to give Chitose a present, so Amane figured he could benefit from his
friend’s experience.
“Oh, and no girl hates hand cream,” Itsuki added.
“Hand cream?”
As Amane was pondering this unexpected option, Itsuki grinned and
explained proudly, “No matter what age they are, every girl has some use
for it. If she’s a student, her hands get dry from handling notebooks and
textbooks in class; if she’s in the workforce, her hands dry out from typing
and air conditioning; and housewives cook and clean, so their hands take a
beating, too. You can’t go wrong with that stuff.”
“Hmm. You sure know an awful lot about women’s hands...,” Amane
said.
“You’re the one who came and asked me!” Itsuki snapped.
Itsuki slapped Amane on the back, but there was no power behind it.
The two friends shared a laugh.
_Hand cream, huh? I guess that is a pretty safe bet._
Amane had been taking the initiative on washing the dishes after dinner,
but Mahiru obviously did her own dishes at home, so he could imagine her
hands could use some moisturizing. More importantly, Amane was sure she
took care of her hands already, since they were so smooth. A gift she could
use right away really was the best plan.
“Cool, thanks for your thoughts,” Amane said.
“Let’s try asking Chi, too. As a fellow girl, she probably has a better
idea,” proposed Itsuki.
“...Eh...”
“You gotta warm up to her.”
Amane certainly didn’t hate her, but Chitose was not exactly his favorite
type of girl, and being around her always made him feel awkward. Usually,
he tried to avoid interacting with her altogether. Itsuki slapped Amane’s
back again gently, smiling in amusement.

“Whaaa—? Amane, you’re giving a girl a birthday present?” Chitose was
smiling—no, smirking—at this rare development, and it was all Amane


could do not to grimace.
He had gone to Chitose’s classroom to talk to her after school, and sure
enough, she seemed greatly amused. Incidentally, Itsuki had sent Chitose a
message saying that he wasn’t worried about her being alone with another
boy as long as it was Amane, so he had gone on home. Amane had sighed
softly, while Chitose had worn a wide grin.
_I told him I didn’t want to ask her._
It was obvious that she was definitely going to pry and ridicule him, so
he hadn’t intended to turn to her for help at all. Amane certainly didn’t hate
Chitose, but he couldn’t deny that there were some things about her that he
just couldn’t stand.
“Okay, so Itsuki wrote here that ‘ _Amane was hoping you’d give him
some pointers_ .’ So you want my help, huh?”
“You’re the only girl I can ask, Chi.”
“It doesn’t sound very nice when you put it like that, you know.”
Chitose looked at Amane with clear pity, but he let it pass.
The truth was, Amane had no female friends outside of Chitose. Every
single girl in his class barely counted as acquaintances, and he wasn’t close
enough to any of them to be able to ask for help with things like this.
Actually, Amane was usually rather quiet in school. If one of his female
classmates tried to talk to him, he probably wouldn’t know what to do.
“All right, well, I can’t imagine you really understand how girls think,
Amane. But don’t worry! Miss Chitose is here to advise you!”
“...I guess I’m in your hands,” Amane said.
“You guess? What’s to guess? I may not look it, but I know women’s
hearts perfectly!”
“I mean, you are a girl, after all...I guess.”
“Watch it with those guesses, buddy! I’m not sure I like what you’re
implying!”
Chitose cleared her throat and thrust out her chest. Compared to Mahiru,
who Amane saw every day, the result was underwhelming at best. Amane
awkwardly stared at the ground.
Regardless of what he personally thought, Chitose was popular with
guys. Personality-wise, she was cheerful and friendly, and she talked to
everyone without playing favorites, so hers was a different kind of
popularity than Mahiru’s. She got along with boys and girls alike. She


really was the epitome of a life-of-the-party kind of person.
She had apparently been a member of the track-and-field club in middle
school, and her slender build and toned legs certainly didn’t hurt her
popularity. It was a verifiable fact that her legs were beautiful, so much so
that Itsuki had warned other guys in school that he’d get angry if they stared
at her too much.
“Ah, right, right,” Chitose chittered. “Something for a cute girl, let’s
see...”
There were definitely times when she got too friendly, but Amane
wouldn’t deny that Chitose was cute. He could understand why other guys
in school liked her.
“...You know,” Chitose added, “that glum attitude of yours is seriously
gonna give people the wrong idea.”
“Gee, thanks for your concern,” Amane replied.
“Fine, fine. So you’re giving something to a girl, right? Well, what kind
of girl?”
Chitose’s question didn’t leave him much room to maneuver, but Amane
knew that if he was careless with what he told her, she wouldn’t let him live
it down, so he chose his words gingerly.
“She’s an acquaintance of mine, and she’s relatively young. Beyond that,
I’m exercising my right to remain silent.”
“Uh...if you won’t tell me her about her personality or what she likes,
even I can’t come up with any ideas, you know.”
“Can’t you just tell me some things that you would like to get as a gift?
Then I’ll choose from among them.”
“I get it; you don’t want to tell me anything about her. Fine, we’ll do it
your way.”
Chitose made a good point, but if he told her any more, she would know
that Amane was close to a girl their age, and it was likely that the
conversation would veer off in a strange and uncomfortable direction from
there. If he really slipped up, Chitose might even end up figuring out that he
was talking about Mahiru.
Amane wanted to avoid that if at all possible, so he’d decided not to tell
her anything that wasn’t strictly necessary. Chitose also seemed to
understand that he wouldn’t willingly reveal much more, and thankfully,
she was kind enough to back off on the questions.


“Hmm, let’s see... I don’t know what type of relationship you have with
her, but if she’s an acquaintance you speak with fairly often, I’m assuming
she would be happy to receive something from a person who’s about as
close to her as I am to you. In that case, generally a consumable or everyday
item that’s not too expensive should be good.”
“Itsuki told me pretty much the same thing,” Amane said.
“Obviously. He understands how girls think. Now, if you’re looking for
a casual gift, some sweets and a handkerchief or some small item might be
good. If I got an expensive accessory from you, Amane, I’d totally be like
‘A bribe?!’ or something.”
“I don’t think I would get anything out of bribing you, though.”
After shooting Amane a glance that seemed to be asking for some sort of
recompense for her help, Chitose smiled and answered, “Well, you’ve got
that right. Anyway, little things like that are safe.”
“...Gotcha.”
“You sound kinda unsatisfied.” Chitose cocked her head.
“It’s not that I’m not satisfied, but...” Amane trailed off. In truth, he just
wasn’t sure that Mahiru would appreciate the sort of gift that he would
select. She probably had impeccable taste, and she seemed like the type to
choose things that combined quality and functionality. Amane wasn’t sure if
his choice would measure up.
Chitose could sense a slight hesitation in Amane’s demeanor, and she
hummed a bit to herself. “...Let’s see... Another option might be...
something cute?”
“...Such as?”
“Depends on the person’s tastes. For example, a stuffed animal or a
keychain with an adorable character on it. I think giving her something like
that might work.”
Amane blinked back at Chitose after hearing the unexpected suggestion,
and Chitose smiled knowingly. “Most girls enjoy cute things, you see.
There are even some people who keep collecting stuffed animals long after
they grow up, and lots of girls like them in general, right?”
“...A stuffed animal, huh...?” Amane didn’t know whether Mahiru had
any girly interests, but she did wear clothes decorated with cute frills and
ornaments, so she probably didn’t hate cuter things like stuffed animals.
Amane could certainly imagine Mahiru being happy to receive a plush


toy.
“Oh, do I sense some interest?” Chitose smirked. Apparently, she had
caught the minute change that had come over Amane. He nodded, though
he was still unsure, and let out a small sigh.
“...But it’ll be too weird for me to buy a stuffed animal, I think,” Amane
admitted.
“It’s a present; you’re not buying it for yourself. What’s the problem?”
Chitose asked.
“I mean, a guy my age, carrying a stuffed animal to the register...?”
“You really are pathetic, you know that?”
“Mm-hmm.”
There was no denying it, but it still hurt Amane to hear it. He ought to
be able to get over such a petty hang-up, but even walking into a store that
carried stuffed animals by himself was enough to make him feel
embarrassed.
Fortunately, Chitose was with him today. Amane thought he might be
able to convince her to accompany him to a shop on the way home. It
certainly wasn’t out of the question, but...
“...Chitose, come with me,” said Amane.
“Whatcha mean?”
“...Please accompany me to go shopping.”
“Hmm, I wonder if I should...” It was just like Chitose to tease him like
this.
Of course, she didn’t really have any intention of refusing Amane’s
request, but there could be no doubt that she was putting on a deliberate act,
both to make fun of Amane and to force him to beg for her help.
“I’m asking you, please. I’m really counting on you,” Amane pleaded.
“Mmm, I guess I could go... By the way, Amane, I feel like eating
something sweet. And the crepe stand in front of the station has a super-
delicious-looking limited-time item...”
“...Please allow me to treat you.”
“Yay!”
Amane grimaced at Chitose’s clever manipulation, but he realized it was
a small price to pay for her help. It was way better to pay for one crepe than
to go into a cutesy shop all on his own. Amane let out a powerful sigh as he
looked at Chitose, who was grinning impishly, then mentally calculated his


approximate budget based on what was in his wallet.

After consulting Itsuki and Chitose, Amane had at last made a decision on
what to give Mahiru for her birthday. Staring at the back of the girl in
question, a nervous expression overtook Amane’s face.
As compensation for a deluxe crepe from the shop in front of the station,
the Wintertime Limited Edition Berry Berry Special to be exact, Amane had
asked Chitose for one more thing. It and the actual present were now sitting
in a bag together. The problem was that Amane was completely at a loss for
when he should give the gift to Mahiru.
The birthday girl was fixing dinner as usual, with no change in
demeanor.
Amane didn’t know what was on the menu, but it had the air of Japanese
food and certainly didn’t seem like anything special. She seemed relaxed as
she went about her preparations.
Mahiru had made no indication at all that today was anything but
another regular day. She was acting so normal that Amane wondered if
perhaps she even knew.
As Mahiru started setting the table, Amane couldn’t help but notice that
her face remained completely unchanged. The two ate an extremely typical
dinner and held a totally normal conversation. Through it all, Amane
remained completely unsure of when best to present her with the gifts he’d
gotten. Frowning, he glanced in the direction of the paper bag hidden
behind his sofa.
He decided to wait until they had cleaned up after dinner and returned to
the living room, when he could take a seat beside Mahiru on his two-person
sofa. She’d brought some books to look over after their meal, so that
seemed as good a time as any.
True to her nickname, the angel was just as beautiful when she was
reading.
Without knowing why, Amane hesitated a little to sit next to her, but
even if he hesitated, there was no way around it, so he grabbed the paper
gift bag from its hiding place and sat down next to Mahiru.
Immediately, the girl’s head snapped up. Whether she’d noticed
Amane’s presence or heard the sound of the crinkling paper bag was


unclear. Either way, her caramel-colored eyes turned toward Amane before
shifting to what he was holding.
Mahiru looked confused, as if she still hadn’t realized that this was
about her birthday.
“Here. For you.” Amane placed the bag on Mahiru’s knees, and the
girl’s expression grew even more puzzled.
“What is this?” she asked.
“It’s your birthday, right?”
“That’s true...but wait, how did you know that? I don’t remember telling
anyone.” Mahiru was suddenly on guard.
“Remember when you dropped your school ID in my apartment?”
Amane reminded her.
She seemed to understand, and her normal expression returned. “I really
wish you hadn’t gone to the trouble. I...don’t celebrate my birthday.”
Amane was certain that he’d heard a bit of cold detachment in Mahiru’s
voice when she spoke. The look in her eyes told him that even the word
_birthday_ was something she avoided.
_I see_ , he thought. _So the reason why she didn’t act any differently, even
though it’s her birthday, wasn’t because she forgot... She’s been purposely
ignoring it. Something about it must bother her._
Amane figured that if that wasn’t the case, Mahiru wouldn’t have
spoken like that.
“Okay then, call it an expression of gratitude for everything you do for
me. I just decided to give you something to repay you.”
Setting aside any mention of Mahiru’s birthday, Amane pressed the bag
on her, justifying it as his way of thanking her for her daily kindnesses. She
cooked delicious meals for him every evening and helped him with his
cleaning sometimes. When it came down to it, Mahiru did a lot to take care
of Amane. He wanted to repay that debt in whatever small way possible.
Amane held out the present to Mahiru, but she shrank away. First, she
looked confused, then she frowned at Amane’s determination. Finally, she
accepted the gift bag.
“...Well, can I open it?” Mahiru asked.
“Yeah,” Amane said.
Mahiru nodded and gingerly pulled out the box that was inside the paper
bag, then she carefully untied the ribbon and removed the wrapping paper.


Something about watching Mahiru open the gift made Amane extremely
nervous.
Inside the box was the hand cream Itsuki had suggested. It was nestled
in a largish box alongside some sweets. Apparently, it’d been some kind of
set. It wasn’t the kind of hand cream that smelled particularly nice, nor was
it all that stylish. Instead, it was the scentless kind that was gentle on the
skin. That way, it wouldn’t cause any trouble while doing housework. This
was the sort that was advertised as moisture-retaining. Amane had made
sure to check the reviews of the product on the Internet, so he was certain of
its efficacy.
“Yeah, sorry it’s nothing too crazy. I just thought that since you do a lot
of housework, your hands might get dry. They had scented ones, too, but I
thought you might have some of those already. Apparently, it’s effective
and easy on the skin.”
“It is...quite practical,” Mahiru said.
“I thought you would value practicality over anything else,” answered
Amane.
“Yeah, you’re right. Thank you very much.” Mahiru smiled slightly, as if
she understood Amane’s reasoning. A little less nervous now, Amane’s
expression softened a bit as well. It seemed like he’d made a good
impression.
There was one more present, though, and Amane felt embarrassed to
have Mahiru open this one in front of him for some reason. He’d hoped that
she would only notice it after she had gone back home.
However, Mahiru was peering into the paper bag, looking as if she had
already noticed that there was one more thing hiding within it.
“...What, a second one?” she asked.
“Ah. Yeah, there is. It’s a bonus; I picked it out myself,” Amane
answered.
“What does that mean?”
“...Exactly what I said.”
Amane averted his eyes. Mahiru tilted her head in confusion for an
instant, then promptly pulled the second gift from the bag.
To purposefully disguise this other present, Amane had intentionally
wrapped it in paper the same color as the interior of the bag. He’d hoped
that would make it stand out less—and that Mahiru would only notice it


later when he wasn’t around. Unfortunately, it was large enough that Amane
should’ve known it would be impossible to miss. There was honestly no
way Mahiru could have overlooked it.
Unlike the hand cream, this present didn’t come in a box, just a
polyester bag. It was just about the right size to fit comfortably in Mahiru’s
arms. The bag was tied up with a navy-blue ribbon, and Amane watched
Mahiru undo that carefully as well, wondering if it would be all right for
him to stand up from his seat. Finally, Mahiru carefully pulled out what lay
inside.
She held the bag’s contents up gently with both hands, blinking her large
eyes dramatically, looking truly surprised.
“...A bear?” Mahiru mumbled.
It was a stuffed animal. Not too large, it was perfectly proportioned for
an elementary school student. Its light-colored fur was soft, much like
Mahiru’s own hair. A light-blue ribbon was tied around the toy’s neck to
form a collar. It had a rather cherubic look stitched onto its face, and the
round, cute button eyes had a luster to them that reflected Mahiru’s face as
they stared at her.
Doubtless, the girl was wondering why Amane had given her such a
thing when she was in high school. The truth was that Amane had taken a
risk and chosen it based on Chitose’s advice that girls liked cute things no
matter how old they were.
Of course, he had been much too embarrassed to go buy the bear alone,
so Chitose had come with him to make the purchase, though only in
exchange for the deluxe crepe from the shop in front of the station.
Chitose’s smiling face had loomed over Amane throughout the whole
process of buying the bear and getting it wrapped. In the end, he couldn’t
help but think it might’ve been better if he’d just gone alone. Though, there
was nothing he could do about it now.
“...I thought it looked like something a girl would like,” Amane
mumbled to no one in particular, scratching his head. He was terrible at
stuff like this.
The last time he’d gotten a present for a member of the opposite sex was
when he’d given gifts to his mother as a little kid. Amane had never once
thought he’d have to pick something out for a girl.
_So it doesn’t faze her to get a cute stuffed animal from a boy, huh...?_


Risking a quick glance at Mahiru, Amane saw her staring directly into
the bear’s face.
He couldn’t tell from her expression whether she was happy, only that
her eyes were fixed on the stuffed animal.
“I mean... If you don’t like it, you can just toss it,” Amane said, hoping
to diffuse the situation with some light humor.
Mahiru turned sharply toward him and drew her eyebrows tightly into a
frown. “I would never!”
“S-sure, I, uh, didn’t think you would or anything.”
The response had been so absolute that Amane couldn’t help but flinch
and barely managed to nod in answer. Mahiru looked back at the bear in her
hands again.
“...I would never do such a cruel thing. I’ll treasure it.” Slender arms
embraced the stuffed bear, as if to wrap it up entirely. Amane couldn’t
decide if Mahiru looked more like a child with a favorite toy or a mother
protecting an infant. Either way, she certainly embraced the bear
enthusiastically, looking down at the thing as though it were the most
precious object in the world.
Mahiru’s face was not the stony mask she kept up at school, nor was it
the face she often wore when she was exasperated with Amane. This time it
was peaceful, soft, and somewhat affectionate—an unmistakably sweet
expression.
Amane felt an innocence in her, and her pure smile was beautiful enough
to take his breath away. She was really exceptionally cute.
_I shouldn’t be staring_ , Amane thought. Mahiru was liable to notice if he
kept looking at her like that.
Amane was certain that he wasn’t in love, but seeing a beautiful girl
make a face like that, and knowing that he was the cause of it, undeniably
made his heart throb. She looked so adorable as she sat there with a faint
smile, hugging the stuffed animal to her chest. Anyone who saw her
would’ve been captivated by the sight. Amane certainly was, despite his
usual reservations.
Just pressing a palm to her face would’ve made it immediately apparent
how much warmer it was than usual. Embarrassed after being so open with
her emotions, she swore under her breath. “...Damn.” The word was so
quiet it could barely be heard.


Fortunately, Mahiru did not seem to have noticed how Amane was
looking at her, because her face was half-buried in the stuffed animal that
she was clutching to her chest.
She still looked extremely sweet, and Amane was worried he would say
something strange in spite of himself.
“...I’m really glad you like it.” Thankfully, Amane managed to keep
what he said brief.
Quickly, Mahiru turned to face him. “This is the first time I’ve ever
received something like this.”
“Huh? With how popular you are, I thought you’d be getting presents
like this all the time...”
“What do you take me for...?” It came as a relief to see Mahiru’s usual
behavior return, but that was only because Amane couldn’t see her current
expression behind the bear. “...I never told anyone when my birthday was,”
Mahiru continued, looking back down at the stuffed animal. “I hate that
day, so I don’t really share it.”
Mahiru’s expression softened as she looked at her gift, though her words
remained sharp. The apparent dissonance set Amane on edge a bit.
“Normally, I hate getting presents from strangers, so I don’t accept
them,” Mahiru explained.
“You’re accepting this, though,” Amane said.
“...Fujimiya...,” Mahiru said quietly, “you’re not a stranger.”
Face still half-buried in fur, Mahiru looked up toward Amane again. She
wore a dreamy, innocent expression. It was captivating, and as Amane
gazed at the angel sitting on his couch, he realized he was in trouble.
Mahiru was so cute that Amane found himself reaching unbidden to
stroke her hair, and he had to quickly stuff his hand behind his back before
he did something really awkward.
_...That was close!_ If Amane had let his guard down, he probably
would’ve started patting Mahiru on the head right then and there. Doing
something so inappropriate would have destroyed everything he’d built
with her.
“...What is it?” Mahiru asked.
“N-nothing,” Amane replied shyly.
Perhaps Mahiru had seen his arm move, or maybe she’d noticed his
obvious distress as he struggled to keep his alarming feelings from bubbling


to the surface. Mahiru’s head tilted to one side in puzzlement. That simple
movement was enough to leave Amane speechless, and it occurred to him
that beautiful girls possessed a terrifying power. Still, he felt embarrassed
for being so captivated by Mahiru’s cuteness. He was also confident that if
he told her how he felt, she would just be confused.
Something about the feeling instilled a sense of danger in Amane, and
he did his best to push it deep down.
“...Thank you very much, Fujimiya,” Mahiru said in a soft voice, but
Amane had already turned away from her.

“Hey, hey, Amane, how’d it go with that girl you got the present for?”
Obviously Chitose was going to pry, since Amane had convinced her to
come along shopping with him. The day after Mahiru’s birthday, Amane
was confronted by Chitose’s grinning inquiry.
Chitose was in a different class but had come to his classroom after
school. That alone wasn’t much of an issue, but hers was the sort of smile
that made Amane feel like she was up to something. Today especially, he
felt the urge to turn and run.
“Nothing happened—at least, not anything like you’re imagining,”
Amane answered.
It was the truth. He definitely wasn’t holding on to any amorous
feelings, and he hadn’t given Mahiru the present because he hoped it would
lead to the start of something more. Sure, she’d graciously accepted the
gifts, but there had certainly been no romantic developments of the kind
that Chitose anticipated.
“Now hold on,” Itsuki interrupted, “The fact that you were so concerned
about someone at all is a pretty rare thing, you know. You suddenly have
some acquaintance that you seem involved with, and it’s a girl. Very
suspicious.”
“It’s nothing like that.” Amane knew he had to shut this down now. He
was happy that Mahiru had been pleased with her gifts, but he was starting
to think that bringing other people into the situation was more trouble than
it’d been worth.
Not wanting to feed their curiosity anymore, Amane had answered as
bluntly as possible, but Itsuki had his hand to his mouth, as if he was


pondering something.
“...Hmm...say, Amane?”
“What is it?”
“Is it possible that the person you gave the present to is...your
neighbor?”
Itsuki was smart and very perceptive, which at times like these could be
a real pain.
“...What makes you think that?” Amane asked nervously.
“Well, she’s the only person I could think of that bothers taking care of
you. And you’re not from around here, so you don’t know many people.
Plus, you don’t hang out with many girls. She brought you dinner that other
day, right? I was thinking that maybe this was about you wanting to return
the favor.”
“Well...”
“Hmm...Amane has been looking very healthy recently, right, Chi?”
“Oh, I thought so, too.”
“She must be bringing him meals pretty frequently, huh? I wonder if
that’s why he wanted to give her a birthday present, to thank her?”
Amane fought to maintain a blank expression as Itsuki perfectly
described the situation to Chitose. It was so accurate that it was like he had
been there to watch it all go down. Sometimes Itsuki was scary like that.
Amane could see why his friend was so popular. He was a bit of a show-off
but also smart and thoughtful. Amane just wished Itsuki would save the
grandstanding for his girlfriend.
“What an overactive imagination...,” Amane interjected.
“Well, you won’t fess up, so imaginations are all we’ve got. C’mon, spill
it!” Itsuki pressed.
“Who knows...?”
“You’re holdin’ out on us!”
“So stingy!” Chitose chimed in agreement.
“Shut up.”
No matter what anyone said, Amane wasn’t planning on confirming the
truth. If he let anything slip, Itsuki and Chitose would never stop hounding
him until he’d spit out the whole story. Really, Itsuki was only the tip of the
iceberg; Amane was in the presence of a high school girl who loved gossip,
especially when it came to romantic affairs. While there wasn’t the slightest


bit of romance to be found here, if Chitose got one whiff of the person
involved, Amane would never hear the end of it.
Sighing in exasperation, Amane finished packing his things and
shouldered his backpack. He’d decided on a strategic retreat, before his two
friends gave him heartburn.
“See ya. You two can go ahead and flirt all you like in private,” Amane
said.
“We were gonna do that whether you said to or not!” Itsuki shouted.
“...Itsuki, weren’t we gonna tail him and try to meet the girl in
question...?”
“Yeah, uh, you probably shouldn’t discuss your operation in front of the
target... And anyway, there’s nothing to see. Even if there was, you two
would never make it past the lobby!” Amane scolded.
“Tch!” Chitose’s lips curled into a cute pout, but her eyes were serious.
Apparently, she really had been planning on tailing Amane. Nervously
hurrying out of the room, Amane left his friends behind.

“...That was a close one,” Amane grumbled without thinking.
“What was?” Mahiru asked him curiously.
It was still a little early to make dinner, but Amane and Mahiru had gone
shopping and come back to his apartment. They’d been relaxing for a bit,
when Mahiru overheard Amane talking to himself.
Mahiru had been acting the same as usual; there was no trace of the girl
who’d been so enamored with the stuffed bear. The same placid expression
remained, and Amane wondered if perhaps he’d dreamed up the whole
birthday incident. Actually, he preferred her this way. He wasn’t sure his
heart could stand regularly seeing her look at him the way she had the other
day.
“Ah, well, Itsuki and Chitose were suspicious about the present.”
Amane intended to explain that he’d consulted them about the present,
but Mahiru seemed to remember Itsuki’s name, and she exhaled, saying
“Ah, I see” as if she understood.
“Well, it didn’t seem like the sort of thing you would buy on your own.”
“That’s not what I was concerned about...”
Apparently, no one thought Amane was capable of getting a gift for a


girl. If he was being honest, he really didn’t think he’d ever experience the
many sweet and bitter feelings that were supposed to accompany love all at
once.
“My shopping is my business. Why does everyone think that way about
me anyway?”
Certainly, Mahiru was cute, and yesterday he’d felt a desire to reach out
and touch her. That much he couldn’t deny, but what young man wouldn’t
have felt that way? Mahiru was outrageously beautiful, after all. Amane had
been caught up in her beauty; that was all. Nothing about what had
happened was evidence he had any deeper feelings. Mahiru was a great
person, but Amane was not interested in her like that.
He glanced over at Mahiru. She was just as beautiful as ever, but
Amane’s heart didn’t pound like it had the night before. Once again, he
reminded himself that he didn’t care for Mahiru in any meaningful way.
Worried that Mahiru would say something if she caught Amane staring
at her, he looked down at his phone instead. When he did, he realized he’d
received a ton of new texts. Thinking it was probably Itsuki, Amane
decided to check them, but it turned out they hadn’t come from his friend.
Amane frowned at the sender’s name: SHIHOKO.
She was one of only three female contacts in Amane’s phone. There was
Chitose, Mahiru, and...Amane’s mother.
Wondering what she could possibly want, Amane tapped the message
thread. He hated dealing with his mother’s high-strung questions, always
asking him how exams were going or whether he needed anything. He
could barely handle Chitose, and yet some members of his family were just
like her. In fact, Chitose might become very much like Amane’s mother as
she got older. Shihoko wasn’t so bad that Amane outright hated her, but he
couldn’t stand his mother’s personality.
_“I brought some fruit back from Grandfather’s, so I’m going to share it
with you, Amane. I’m sending it over, so be at your place on Saturday
afternoon! I won’t forgive you if you refuse delivery or aren’t there to get it,
okay?”_
“So you can just decide my plans all on your own...?” Amane muttered.
Now, he didn’t actually have any plans for Saturday, but he thought his
mother ought to have at least contacted him a little earlier.


“Did something happen?” Mahiru must have heard Amane’s
whisperings, because she looked over at him with her usual calm
expression.
“My mom picked some fruit at my grandpa’s place, and she’s sending it
here on Saturday afternoon. Probably apples and stuff,” Amane explained.
“Do you peel your apples?”
“...I guess I could do that, with a peeler.”
“That would peel them, but...it’ll take off a lot of the flesh, too, so it’s a
little wasteful.”
Mahiru’s words sounded like something Amane’s mother would say, and
he tried to swallow that thought before it surfaced.
“If it comes down to it, we can just eat them whole,” he said.
“How savage.”
“It’s a pain to peel them.” Amane shrugged and grinned haplessly.
“You’re such a mess.” Despite Mahiru sounding annoyed and giving a
rather brutal assessment of Amane’s table manners, the way she held herself
also showed some understanding. “I guess it’s all the same once you eat
them.”
“You know, I’m not sure I’ll be able to eat them all before they go bad.
Do you want some, too?” asked Amane.
“Sure, I’d be happy to take some. Fruit is expensive, after all.” It was
kind of a domestic thing to say, but then again, that was the kind of person
Mahiru was.
“Saturday, right? In that case, I’ll make us lunch beforehand as thanks,”
Mahiru said.
“But you’re always taking care of me already,” Amane protested.
“Like I’ve told you, I really don’t mind making food for you, Fujimiya.”
Mahiru smiled very slightly. Somehow, the little grin made Amane feel
awkward. It called to mind the events of the previous day, and Amane
couldn’t help but avert his eyes from the beautiful angel in his apartment.
“...All right, thanks,” he replied curtly.


Asking Mahiru to pick up her portion of the fruit as soon as the package
arrived turned out to be a big mistake. When Amane heard the sound of the
intercom and the high-pitched, mischievous voice that called “Aaa-maaa-
neee!” through it, he understood that he was in trouble.
Amane had been very grateful for Mahiru’s proposal to make lunch for
him on Saturday. It had seemed a veritable blessing from heaven at the
time. Truly, the carbonara she’d whipped up had been delicious. The thick-
bodied sauce and the kick of black pepper were a perfect match, and it’d
been tremendously tasty.
Mahiru hadn’t done anything wrong. Those at fault were Amane himself
for failing to recognize in advance what his mother had meant by telling
him to be home on Saturday for the delivery and that irksome, surprise-
loving woman herself.
“...Um, Fujimiya? Is that the delivery...?” Mahiru asked.
“Nope. That would be my mother. She’s probably using her duplicate
key to get through the front door and is heading up right now,” Amane
explained. Thinking back on it, it had been his own mistake to take what his
mother had said at face value. One way or another, she always created
situations that allowed her to come by and check in on him. Amane’s
mother could never resist employing a little misdirection.
“...Uh, your mother?”
“She probably came to see whether I’m getting along okay...and she
didn’t tell me she was coming. Probably because she knew I would clean up
in advance.”


“Uh-huh...”
“I know it’s all a bit hard to swallow, but that doesn’t matter right now.”
Right now, the problem was what to do with Mahiru. If Amane’s mother
had still been in the lobby downstairs, he could have sent Mahiru home, but
that was out of the question now that she was approaching his door. At the
same time, his mother was sure to get the wrong idea if he invited her into
his apartment and she came across Mahiru. There was no doubting that
Mahiru would hate that as much as Amane would.
The longer Amane puzzled over what to do, the closer his mother was
getting to just barging right in.
_I can’t believe this is happening..._ Amane did have an idea, but he didn’t
like it.
“...I’m sorry, Shiina, but could you please hide in my bedroom?”
“Huh, wh-what?”
“Take your stuff with you, and once I find some way to get my mom
outside, you can go back home. I’m really sorry, but please?”
With no other viable option, Amane took the helm and steered Mahiru
into concealing herself. Thankfully, they’d already finished cleaning up
after lunch, so that wouldn’t be a giveaway. If he hid her shoes in the shoe
closet, they wouldn’t be discovered, and Mahiru could just bring her
personal effects into Amane’s room.
The plan was to let Amane’s mom to make a quick inspection of the
apartment while Mahiru was hiding. Amane would mention to his mother
that he really wanted to eat her home cooking, something that’d probably
keep her too busy to push her way into his room.
Whatever it took, Amane had to keep his mother from breaching the
bedroom.
He would purposely request that his mother cook something that used an
ingredient he didn’t have in his refrigerator. If the two of them went out
shopping together, that would provide Mahiru with a window to escape.
Amane hurriedly explained to Mahiru that such a scheme was the only
option as he handed her his extra key and asked her to cooperate with the
greatest sincerity he could muster.
“O-okay,” she said, nodding in bewilderment.
In truth, the storage room was also an option, but Amane didn’t want a
girl to wait in there. It had no heating, which meant it was quite cold this


time of year. Amane’s bedroom had a proper heater, as well as soft
cushions. It wouldn’t do to have Mahiru sitting on a bare floor while she
shivered from the cold.
“...All right, I’m counting on you. I have to deal with my mom, so...”
Even before meeting his mother, Amane looked dejected. He headed for
the entrance while Mahiru quietly slipped into the bedroom. After making
sure that the angel was hidden, Amane reluctantly opened the front door.
“My goodness Amane, that took you long enough. I’m glad to see
you’re looking well. I was starting to wonder if you were asleep.”
There was Amane’s mother, standing just outside his apartment. He
hadn’t seen her since summer break.
Although she was a parent, it would have been difficult to tell from her
looks alone. It wasn’t just that her face looked young, she never acted her
age, either. She wore the same sort of happy expression she often had back
when Amane was still living at home.
“Yeah, yeah, I’m perfectly fine, so how about heading home?”
“How can you say that to your own mother? It took me several hours to
get here, you know? Don’t I even get a thank-you?”
“Thank you very much for traveling a great distance, now please go
home.”
“Come now, don’t say such things. It’s not very endearing. You should
act more like Shuuto, your father!”
“Men don’t need to be endearing, do we?” While Amane had spat his
words acidly, his mother, Shihoko, didn’t seem bothered at all, instead
breaking into a fit of laughter.
“You’ve really hit your rebellious phase!” she said. “I hope you’re not
planning on having me stand outside all day. I’m coming in, okay?”
“Wait, nobody said you could—”
“Have you forgotten that your father and I pay the rent on this place?”
There was nothing Amane could do to argue or refuse his mother once
she’d played that card. Reluctantly, he allowed her to enter.
To keep her from going into the bedroom, Amane casually guided his
mother to walk past the bedroom door and into the living room.
“By the way, you really should tell me beforehand when you plan on
visiting,” said Amane.
“Now, I wouldn’t be able to get a proper picture of my son’s living


situation if I didn’t show up unannounced, would I?” Shihoko replied.
“Ugh... Look, there’s no problem, okay? I’m keeping the place clean.”
“You certainly are; I’m surprised. You never kept your room clean at
home, but you’re doing better than I’d expected. I’m surprised.” Shihoko
nodded seriously, looking genuinely astonished as she surveyed the living
room.
The unspoken truth was that his place was only clean because Mahiru
had helped Amane tidy up. Her advice and constant scolding was a big part
of how his place had managed to stay clean, too. Really, Mahiru deserved
most of the credit, but there was no way Amane was going to tell his
mother that now.
“Your skin looks good, too; you must be eating well,” Shihoko
observed.
“...Yeah,” Amane admitted, unable to meet his mother’s eyes. Even his
improved health was something he owed to the angel.
“You’re even cooking properly, huh. Oh, but it looks like you’re cooking
for two?”
Shihoko’s manicured finger was pointing at his dish rack. Two people
had eaten lunch, so naturally there were two sets of dishes. Carelessly,
Amane had forgotten to put them away. He should’ve remembered how
perceptive his mother could be.
“Yeah, I had a friend over.” Amane’s answer was not quite a lie. He’d
spoken as indifferently as he was able, doing his best to stop himself from
shaking. It was fair to say that he and Mahiru had built up to something
resembling a friendship, so it wasn’t exactly untrue. There was the small
matter of hiding that the friend in question was a girl.
“Hmm,” Shihoko replied with a tone that suggested she didn’t really
accept that explanation at face value. She scanned the living room again.
“I suppose you get a passing mark. You’re doing so well, I can hardly
believe you’re a boy living on his own,” Amane’s mother finally conceded.
Somehow, Amane had been able to deceive her, though only just barely.
Strangely, he felt a chill run down his spine, and he was sweating bullets.
On the other hand, maybe he shouldn’t have been so surprised to have
passed his mother’s inspection. Mahiru really had turned some things
around for him, after all.
“See, there was nothing for you to worry about, Mom.”


“I suppose not; though I can hardly believe it. You could barely do
anything for yourself at home. You’ve certainly grown up.”
“...I’m basically an adult,” Amane replied, though inwardly, he scoffed
at himself for having the audacity to say such a thing.
“Good job,” Shihoko praised, smiling.
It made Amane a little uncomfortable to hear that, since of course he
hadn’t done any of it on his own. There was no way he could risk telling his
mother the truth, however, so he would have to leave things as they were
and try to get her out of there.
_She’s pretty much finished her evaluation, right? I wonder if I can get
her to leave without saying anything about wanting to eat her cooking or
whatever_ , Amane thought.
“That just leaves the bedroom check, I suppose,” Shihoko mused
nonchalantly.
Amane’s eyes went wide at the drop of that bomb. Mahiru was still in
there. If his mother found a girl hiding in the bedroom, a far greater disaster
would ensue than if Amane had just revealed Mahiru from the get-go.
“Hey, don’t joke around. Even if you’re my mom, I don’t want you
digging around in my bedroom.”
“Oh? Something in there you’re feeling embarrassed about?” Shihoko
prodded.
“There’s probably one or two embarrassing things in any high school
guy’s room, if you think about it.”
“So you admit it?”
“Yeah, I admit it. Please don’t go in there.”
Even though it was shameful, there’d been no other choice. Amane had
been forced to go along with his mother’s assumption to keep her from
entering the bedroom. If she discovered Mahiru in Amane’s room, she
would most assuredly get the wrong idea. For both his own sake and
Mahiru’s, Amane needed to avoid that at all costs.
When Amane’s mother saw him blocking the door to his room,
desperately trying to keep her from getting through, she could tell right
away that he was hiding something. Closing in on her son, Shihoko said, “I
suppose you are grown up, if you’re hiding those sorts of things from your
parents.”
If it came down to it, Amane was prepared to keep his mom out by force


if necessary, though he admittedly didn’t like that idea. He stood ready to
stop her, but then...
_Thump._ There came a noise from inside the bedroom.
“Amane...”
“Yes.”
“What are you hiding?”
“...It has nothing to do with you, Mom.”
“So you say.” A wide grin spread across Shihoko’s face.
It was the kind of coercive smile that could not be denied. Amane
became extremely uncomfortable every time she looked at him like this. It
had a way of sapping his willpower to oppose her.
Amane groaned, and Shihoko saw an opening. She put her hand on the
doorknob to his room, and by the time Amane noticed, it was far too late.
Shihoko slipped past Amane, intent on discovering the source of the noise
on the other side of the door.
What met her eyes beyond that barrier that Amane had failed to protect
was the figure of a beautiful girl. She was leaning her back against the side
of the bed while hugging a cushion to her chest. The girl’s eyes were
closed, and her breaths were a gentle rhythm. Mahiru had dozed off by the
time Shihoko discovered her.
A warm room with a heater running and a full stomach after lunch were
the perfect conditions for an afternoon nap. Amane couldn’t help but
wonder whether Mahiru often slept in boys’ rooms, but all this really
confirmed was that she found Amane to be harmless enough to doze off in
his bedroom.
He couldn’t exactly blame her for it. Sitting motionless so as not to
make any noise had probably gotten real boring real fast.
The main problem was, obviously, Shihoko, who had arrived at just the
wrong moment to witness a situation she was sure to misunderstand.
Had he been the third party, Amane would have gotten the wrong idea,
too. He would have assumed they were so intimate that Mahiru had no
problem drifting off for a nap in his room.
Grimacing all the while, Amane glanced over at his mother and saw that
her eyes were sparkling. He could only imagine the commotion she was
about to raise.
“Oh my, Amane, you’ve got such an adorable girlfriend!” Shihoko


shrieked in her youthful voice. “This isn’t the kind of girl you can just hide
away in a corner, you know!”
Amane felt a headache coming on.
She had immediately jumped to possibly the worst conclusion available,
and to make matters worse, she was clearly very excited about the idea that
her son was dating such a lovely girl. There was no doubt that even
Amane’s mother was smitten with Mahiru’s beauty.
Mahiru looked so vulnerable when she was asleep. The practiced air of
elegant refinement that she always wore like a mask had melted away,
revealing the full captivating nature of her looks. Her cute face had never
looked more peaceful—or more pretty.
Amane had grown somewhat accustomed to Mahiru’s appearance, but
seeing her like this, he was once again struck by her incredible charm. Her
cherubic face held such an innocent serenity. Once again, he felt the urge to
reach out and touch her. Her sleeping figure, hugging Amane’s cushion
tight, awakened many desires in him that were best kept private.



This truly captivating girl was Amane’s girlfriend, or so his mother
thought. It was no wonder she was excited.
“I suppose the reason you didn’t want your mother looking in this room
is because your girlfriend is here? Look at you, growing up right before my
eyes.”
“That’s not it! You’ve got it all wrong! She’s not my girlfriend or
anything!”
“Come now, you don’t have to make excuses! Your mother has no
intention of opposing your relationship, Amane.”
“No, I’m telling you, that’s not the issue here! We’re not in a romantic
relationship! You’ve got it totally wrong!”
“Well, whether I’m right or wrong, she’s in your bedroom right now,
isn’t she?”
“That’s because you showed up all of the sudden! We were just hanging
out in the living room, but I knew you would misunderstand!”
“You see, the problem with that excuse is that you would never let a girl
you don’t like into your apartment. And I really don’t think a girl would just
waltz right on into the apartment of someone she didn’t like, would she?”
Amane struggled to find a way to argue the issue. His mother was right;
Amane was awfully territorial about his living spaces and wasn’t inclined to
let just anyone into his domain.
The first time Mahiru had come in, she’d practically forced her way, but
ever since then, he’d welcomed her over, even when she wasn’t coming to
cook for him.
_I guess that means I really do like her._
As far as Amane was concerned, he was sure he liked Mahiru for her
personality, not her appearance. He enjoyed that seemingly contradictory
part to her. There was a biting and honest side of her that she didn’t show at
school, and yet she found it hard to be open about her feelings. He liked her
curt and annoyingly helpful attitude and the reserved way she conducted
herself. When she was taken by surprise, she would get flustered, and the
mask would drop momentarily, which was another thing he enjoyed. Most
of all, Amane especially liked that rare angelic smile that he’d only seen
cross her face a few times. He supposed that each of those attributes were
all precious parts of Mahiru’s appeal.
If he had to say whether that was a feeling of romantic love, Amane


would have insisted that it was something else, but he couldn’t deny that
Mahiru was a wonderful girl for many reasons.
“I care about her as a friend. Not every relationship between members of
the opposite sex has to be romantic, you know. And I’m pretty sure she
doesn’t feel that way, either.” Amane was not the kind of mama’s boy who
would obediently play along with whatever Shihoko said. Plus, Mahiru
would certainly object to the suggestion that she had feelings for him.
“Now, you don’t know that, Amane! Aren’t you being rather
presumptuous, thinking you know exactly what her heart wants?”
“What can I say to get you to understand that our relationship is not like
that, Mom...? Shiina, please, help me out here...”
No matter how he tried to explain, Amane’s mother had already made up
her mind. Amane pressed a finger to his forehead, stumped on what to do.
With all possible urgency, he wished Mahiru would just wake up.
“Nn...”
Either Amane’s unspoken prayer had been heard or all the ruckus had,
because Mahiru’s eyelids fluttered open, and she made a sweet noise as she
raised her face. Her flaxen hair slipped over her shoulders. The girl’s
shining eyes, the color of caramel, were blurry with sleep, and she looked
so vulnerable that it felt somehow wrong to look directly at her.
Maybe she wasn’t quite fully awake yet as she looked up at Amane
vacantly, her eyes still relaxed and drowsy. Amane pointedly stared in
another direction.
“Shiina, I don’t mind that you fell asleep, but there’s been a
misunderstanding, so please help me clear things up.”
“Misunderstanding...?”
“Hey, hey, Miss Girlfriend, what’s your name?”
Mahiru was still clearly confused over what had happened, but Shihoko
didn’t hesitate to approach her, beaming with an amiable, carefree smile and
an overly familiar demeanor.
Mahiru was visibly flustered, still trying to get her bearings.
“Huh, uh, um...”
“It’s important to tell each other our names when we first meet, you
know!”
“Ah, I-I’m Mahiru Shiina...”
“Oh, Mahiru, what a cute name that is! I am Shihoko; please don’t be


shy and call me by my first name, okay?”
Mahiru had reflexively given her name when pressed for it. She looked
up at Amane, her eyes begging him for rescue. Unfortunately, Amane was
helpless. He had been hoping Mahiru would save him somehow.
Regretfully, he shook his head. He knew that once his mother got started,
there was really no stopping her. She was set on learning more about
Mahiru, and nothing would dissuade her now. It was unlikely she’d ever
realize just how uncomfortable she was making the poor girl.
“A-all right, um...Mrs., that is, uh, Shihoko...”
“See? That sounds more like my daughter-in-law.”
“Fujimiya!”
“That could be referring to either of us, you know? Right, Amane?
“Mom, you’re bothering Shiina.”
“Amane, you mustn’t be so formal with your sweet new girlfriend; call
her by her first name!”
Shihoko didn’t seem inclined to listen to anything anyone said. Amane
scowled at her, but she didn’t show any sign of letting up. Her smile was
wide and utterly shameless.
“Uh, um, Shihoko?”
“Yes, dear?”
“He and I—”
“Why, I don’t know who you mean. He who?”
“...A-Amane and I; we aren’t dating.”
Even though she was obviously flustered by his mother’s verbal assault,
Mahiru tried her best to set the record straight. Unfortunately, she’d looked
right at Amane and had even been forced to call him by his first name,
which was apparently exactly what Shihoko had been after. The older
woman’s smile grew even wider.
“Well, I suppose it takes time for things like this to blossom. Something
to look forward to,” Shihoko said, quite presumptuously.
“Eh, ah, um, that’s not...,” Mahiru said, trying to object.
“Oh no, I must have intruded just when things were getting good!”
“U-um, I want you to let me explain properly! I don’t have that kind of
relationship with...Amane. We were just having lunch together because
Amane can’t cook!”
“What a wonderful bride you’ll make, sweetie. My Amane set out to


live on his own even though he’s incapable of doing any kind of
housework, you see. So I really do appreciate you supporting him.”
“No, uh—”
Mahiru had put up a heroic effort, but she may as well have been
banging her head against a wall at this point. The moment she’d mentioned
visiting Amane’s place, cooking there, and sitting at the same table as him,
the sparkle in Shihoko’s eyes had changed. The pushy mother somehow
looked even more unhinged than usual to Amane.
Once Shihoko got like this, he knew there was nothing he could do to
stop her. The only person who ever stood a chance was his father, Shuuto.
“Shiina, just give up. My mother won’t listen to anyone when she gets
like this.”
“You can’t be serious...” Mahiru sounded extremely dismayed.
Amane realized that they weren’t getting anywhere. Trying to explain
the situation wasn’t working, and he clearly couldn’t stop his mother’s wild
speculations.
“At any rate, my Amane did quite well to snag such a beauty. I’m
surprised.”
With Amane exhausted from arguing, and Mahiru having no clear idea
what to do, both simply went quiet.
It was possible Amane’s mother took their sudden silence as a sign of
agreement, though Shihoko had doubtlessly already assumed that their
embarrassment was proof enough of her suspicions. She was looking at
Mahiru with no attempt to hide the wild curiosity in her eyes.
“What do you think, Mahiru? Can my Amane really make it, living on
his own?”
“Uh... That’s... Well...,” Mahiru stammered. “...Enough to stay
alive...”
“You should’ve just said I’ll be fine!” Amane interjected.
“I remember the place being pretty bad,” Mahiru reminded him.
“Don’t bring that up. I’m keeping it clean now, aren’t I?”
“And I’ve been helping you with the cleaning this whole time, haven’t
I?”
“That’s true, and I’m grateful for it,” Amane admitted. “All of it, truly—
the food, the cleaning, and everything else.” Mahiru was inarguably the
reason that he’d been able to live so comfortably, and he would bow down


in thanks to her without any hesitation. He knew that she wouldn’t have
done so much if she’d hated it, but he always strove to make his appreciate
known.
As should’ve been expected by now, Amane’s mother interpreted the
exchange in a different light.
“Well now, Amane, so it wasn’t just today’s lunch! Mahiru’s been doing
everything for you this whole time, you useless child. The way you speak to
each other—it’s like you’re already living together!”
“No! How did you even reach that conclusion?! We only live next to
each other!” Amane fired back.
“Aha, so it was fate! Isn’t that wonderful, Amane. You got me such a
beautiful daughter-in-law.”
“I’m not denying that she’s beautiful and talented, but I’m totally against
calling it fate or destiny or whatever!”
“Doesn’t it sound more romantic that way?”
“That’s not what I’m bothered by! I’m telling you we don’t have a
romantic relationship at all!”
“How persistent.” Clearly, Shihoko was choosing to believe that Amane
was still too embarrassed to admit the truth.
Amane’s face contorted into a progressively deeper grimace, and he
heaved his heaviest sigh of the last few months. He couldn’t recall how
many times he’d suffered at the hands of his mother’s wild imagination.
Shihoko was really the kind of woman who just did whatever she wanted.
As for Mahiru, the one who’d been caught unawares by the full weight
of Shihoko’s overwhelming enthusiasm, she could do little else than look
helplessly back and forth between Amane and his mother, utterly
bewildered.
“Mahiru, this is probably a parent’s love talking, but my Amane isn’t
very good with words, and he isn’t very up-front about his feelings, but he
is faithful and gentlemanly. I’d say he’s a pretty good catch. Plus, he doesn’t
have any experience with girls, so you’ll be able to get him to do whatever
you want.”
“What on earth are you saying, Mom? Seriously, cut it out.”
_That last bit especially is none of her business_ , Amane thought angrily.
“I mean, it’s true, isn’t it? If not, then why haven’t you had any other
girlfriends? You resemble your father, so I don’t think it’s your looks.


Maybe it’s because you’re a little immature?”
“It’s n-none of your business.”
“You really should try harder to act cool in front of Mahiru, you know.”
“I will not, and she’s not interested, either,” Amane protested.
“Oh, come now! Sweetie, you can train him to suit your own
preferences, you know. Amane cleans up pretty good if you dress him up.”
Shihoko, grinning madly, struck poor Mahiru again, who could do
nothing but offer a vague sort of smile in return. Not even an angel could
retaliate in a battle like this. Amane’s mother was truly something else.
“Mom, you’re bothering her. Please go home.”
“What a big man you’ve become, telling your mother to go home.”
“I’m serious, please. It’s really obvious that you’re making her
uncomfortable.”
“Oh? Is that true, Mahiru?”
“Don’t ask her; she’ll definitely just say what you want to hear. Just this
once, please head back. You can come back some other time.”
“Well, if you’re going that far, I suppose I get the message. I did barge in
while you were alone with your girlfriend, after all. It’s only natural you’d
be upset to lose your alone time.”
“Fine, you can explain it however you like. Just hurry up and go!”
Amane was beyond tired of arguing with his mother, and this whole
situation had to be taking a toll on Mahiru as well. He looked over and saw
that she also looked exhausted.
Vowing internally to shower her with appreciation later, Amane shooed
his mother away and got a look of sour disapproval in return. Even so,
Shihoko didn’t make an effort to stay, so at least she kind of cared, though it
was obvious her view of reality was still quite different.
“Ah, Mahiru, let’s exchange contact information, shall we? I want a full
report later on how Amane’s doing, among other things.”
“Uh, o-okay...?”
In a last-ditch effort, Shihoko tried to sink her hooks in again. Caught in
the woman’s powerful momentum, Mahiru wound up exchanging contact
information with her. Now Amane’s mother would be able to reach her
directly. The thought made Amane want to press a hand to his forehead.
Beaming wide, Shihoko gripped Mahiru’s hand and reminded the girl to
look after her son. Amane resolved to send his father a message later,


asking him to rein Shihoko in.

“I’m exhausted...”
“Sorry; she’s like a hurricane.”
Shihoko hadn’t stayed all that long, but she’d left the two completely
ragged.
After flumping down on the couch, Amane put his head in his hands and
sighed deeply. Mahiru gingerly took a seat, too, but her usually perfect
posture was bent and haggard. Amane had thought that the angel could
handle anyone, but even she had no energy left after the encounter with his
mother. He was unsure if he should try to apologize.
“I really didn’t want to let her go home still believing the wrong thing,”
Amane admitted.
“Well, there’s no real harm done...,” Mahiru said.
“No, I think there is... If she was acting like that, it probably means that
she’s taken a liking to you... One way or another, she’s gonna be an
issue...”
It was truly unfortunate that this was going to put a burden on Mahiru.
Shihoko’s love for all things adorable, coupled with her mistaking Mahiru
for her son’s girlfriend, almost certainly meant that Amane’s mother would
be finding new ways to poke her nose where it didn’t belong in the days to
come. Trouble was on the horizon.
“Shihoko really cares about you a lot, doesn’t she?”
“That’s a nice way to put it, but sometimes she really just refuses to
listen...”
More than just an overly affectionate parent, Shihoko doted and fawned
on Amane even though he hated it. He knew he shouldn’t complain too
much, since it was probably at least partly his own fault because he was
such hopeless slob. It wasn’t as though he was ungrateful for all his mother
had provided, but she could be a real pain in the butt, and he wished she’d
give him more space.
“...How nice,” Mahiru mumbled quietly.
Amane looked up at her. “What is?”
“Your mother is quite a character but also very kind.”
“That means she’s loud and loves to meddle.”


“...Even so, I think it’s nice.”
Mahiru’s words weren’t an empty compliment; she really did seem
envious as she mumbled and averted her eyes.
A gloomy expression was plain on the girl’s face. So much so that
Amane thought she might break down into tears at the drop of a hat.
Anyone could have sensed how fragile she was right now. It was clearly
more than simple exhaustion.
Mahiru must have noticed Amane looking at her, because she suddenly
looked up and forced her lips into a small smile. Then, just as quickly, she
regained her usual composure and leaned back against the sofa, something
she rarely did.
“Mahiru, huh?”
“...What are you saying all of a sudden?”
“Nothing... I was just thinking that it’s been a while since anyone called
me by my first name. Most people only address me by my family name.”
It was pretty surprising to know that someone who seemed as popular as
Mahiru didn’t actually have any friends close enough to call her by her first
name. Everyone at school saw her as a flawless angel. Even Mahiru’s
acquaintances probably maintained some degree of formality with her, and
nobody had the courage to really get to know her. A lot of students only
ever addressed her by a nickname that Mahiru herself didn’t even like.
“Well, I guess if you don’t have any close friends, that would leave only
your parents, right?” Amane asked.
“My parents would never talk to me that way. Absolutely not.” Mahiru’s
reply was cold.
Looking her over, Amane saw that Mahiru’s face was an expressionless
mask. She resembled a beautiful doll, completely devoid of feeling. That,
too, only lasted a second, however, and Mahiru’s visage changed again
when she noticed that Amane was looking at her. Her eyebrows lowered, as
if she was troubled by something.
“...Anyway, it doesn’t happen often,” she muttered, before letting out a
sigh.
Amane had been wondering for a while if Mahiru had a bad relationship
with her parents. It had been easy enough to imagine that she had problems
at home from her frosty demeanor whenever he touched on the subject.
Plus, she never went out to eat with her parents and hated her own


birthdays, but Amane never would’ve thought Mahiru’s parents were so
distant as to not even call the girl by her first name.
Thinking back to how Mahiru had quietly said she enjoyed Shihoko’s
personality, Amane wondered how the angel must have felt in that moment.
“Mahiru.” Rather suddenly, Amane blurted out the word. He’d never
called his neighbor by her first name before. The girl in question blinked
her caramel eyes. She looked stunned, and Amane could tell that he’d
caught her off guard. The momentary surprise had revealed a youthfulness
about Mahiru that she normally kept hidden.
“It’s your name. Someone ought to call you by it,” Amane reasoned.
“...I suppose you’re right,” Mahiru answered bluntly. A few moments
later, a tiny smile appeared. Amane’s chest felt fluttery when he spotted it.
“...Amane.”
When he heard her small voice pronounce his own first name, the flutter
turned to a storm. Maybe it was because, until just a moment ago, his mom
was the one calling him by his first name, but when Mahiru called him by
his first name face-to-face, he felt the uneasy, impatient stirring in his chest
churn and roar.
“Please don’t call me that outside, okay?” Mahiru reminded.
“...I already wasn’t planning to. That goes for you, too. Don’t slip up
outside the apartment.”
“Understood. It’s our secret, right?”
Amane couldn’t bring himself to look directly at Mahiru, as she was still
grinning a little. Looking away, he responded in agreement and shifted in
his seat, turning away to escape the angel’s smile.

Though Shihoko’s Saturday invasion had been a nightmare, nothing much
had changed aside from how Amane and Mahiru referred to each other.
They hadn’t suddenly become any closer. Addressing each other a little
more directly wasn’t a big deal. At most, perhaps Mahiru’s demeanor had
softened a little, but that was it.
“...Um, Amane?”
Mahiru had come over earlier than usual for dinner on Sunday, perhaps
feeling a little uneasy, because she looked troubled.
Amane was glad to let her in, but he was confused by her peculiar


attitude. He’d thought that maybe using their first names didn’t sit right
with her after all, but when the time had come, she’d said his name without
hesitation, so there must have been something else bothering her.
For the time being, they sat on the sofa together, and as he waited to see
what Mahiru would do, she pulled a handkerchief from her skirt pocket.
As Amane continued to wonder what was up, Mahiru opened the neatly
folded handkerchief to reveal a tarnished silver key. It must have been the
one he’d given her the day before.
“I’m returning your spare key. In the end, I never got the chance to use
it, and then I forgot to give it back. I’m very sorry about that.”
“I see.”
Apparently, Mahiru hadn’t been able to rest until she’d returned the key.
Satisfied that he understood the cause for her strange behavior, Amane
stared at the bit of metal resting on the handkerchief.
Now that he thought about it, Mahiru came over to fix dinner in his
apartment almost every night. Usually, he met her at the door, but
sometimes it took him a while. There’d even been times where Mahiru had
been forced to wait because he wasn’t home. It must have been
inconvenient for her to have to wait outside for him, especially during these
colder months. Somewhere, Amane had heard that chilly weather was a
girl’s worst enemy, and now that he thought about it, he wouldn’t have been
too happy waiting in the cold, either, had the situation been reversed.
Since Mahiru was basically coming over every day, he wondered if it
wouldn’t be easier for her to have a key to get in.
“That’s fine; I think you should keep it,” he said.
“Huh?”
“You can give it back to me whenever we stop spending time together.”
It seemed perfectly reasonable to Amane. Now that Mahiru had the key,
she might as well keep it—but she didn’t seem convinced.
“B-but...”
“I mean, going to the door every time you come over is a hassle.”
“Ah, so that’s what this is about.”
“I doubt you’re going to misuse it or anything.”
“Well, that’s true, but...”
Amane had been sharing meals with Mahiru for more than a month now,
and he figured that he knew her pretty well. She was sensible, considerate,


and kind. He was certain that she would never hand the key over to anyone
else or do anything while Amane wasn’t around. If there was anyone he
could trust, it was Mahiru.
“Besides, you must think it’s a pain to have to ring the buzzer and wait
out there all the time,” Amane said.
“Even if it is, I feel like you’re being a bit careless.”
“But I’m giving it to you because I trust you.”
At that, Mahiru’s eyes went wide, and she floundered for words.
Confusion, along with something else that Amane didn’t really understand,
passed over the girl’s delicate features.
The truth of it was that Amane had only wanted her to have the key to
save himself some trouble, but if she really hated the idea, he was prepared
to back down.
As for Mahiru, she looked intently back and forth between Amane and
the key for a few moments, then finally let out a gentle sigh.
“...Understood. I’ll hold on to it.”
“Mm.”
“You know, I’m never sure if something is a big deal to you, or if you
even care at all, Amane,” Mahiru jabbed with a slightly prickly tone. She
sounded fed up, and Amane couldn’t do anything but smile wryly.
“Suits me well, don’t you think?”
“You shouldn’t say things like that about yourself,” Mahiru admonished.
Amane’s smile grew wider. Mahiru seemed to be growing more
comfortable with this kind of silly back-and-forth. They were now on a
first-name basis, of course. It would’ve been strange if they hadn’t built up
some kind of rapport. While Mahiru’s eyes were still full of exasperation, as
if to say that Amane was really a hopeless case, her gaze wasn’t cold. In
fact, there was a noticeable bit of warmth to it. She understood that Amane
was just joking around.
“All right then, I won’t hesitate to use this. I might even do something to
your apartment without telling you.”
“Like what?”
“...Like...a surprise cleaning!”
“I would be grateful for that.”
“...Or how about if your fridge was suddenly packed full of food?”
“It’d make breakfast easier, and we’d have more options for dinner,


too.”
Mahiru’s idea of a prank clearly needed some work. Amane would’ve
been glad to suffer under any one of her suggestions. That she couldn’t
come up with a real threat even when she truly tried only reminded Amane
of Mahiru’s gentle nature. It was quite charming and brought a smile to his
lips.
“Are you sure you’re not making fun of me?” Mahiru looked like she
ready to pout, which would’ve been cute in its own right, but Amane didn’t
want to upset Mahiru any further.
Suppressing the grin that threatened to break out, Amane said, “Course
not.”


“Well, guess that’s how it goes,” Amane grumbled as he looked the list of
names up and down. The rankings for the previous week’s tests were out, so
Amane had shown up to check them like the rest of his class.
Coming in at twenty-first, Amane was situated around his usual score. It
was a good enough ranking but hardly a result that stood out. He hadn’t
found this exam any more challenging than previous ones, though it was
still a relief to see he’d done as well as he’d expected.
Surprising no one, Mahiru reigned over all the rest from her typical first-
place position. She truly was a genius, but Amane knew perfectly well that
she didn’t attain that position without applying herself. Amane had often
seen her studying after dinner. He wasn’t about to argue that Mahiru wasn’t
smart, but he felt confident that it was the hard work that put her at the top
more than anything else.
“Shiina is first again, huh?”
“Of course she is. The angel’s on a whole different level.”
Such proclamations caused Amane to make a sour face.
“...What’s with that look? Was your rank that bad?” Itsuki came over,
puzzled by his friend’s odd expression.
Only the top fifty test scores had been posted. As such, Itsuki hadn’t
come to see his own score, but rather, to accompany Amane.
“It’s nothing. I’m twenty-first.”
“Oh? Isn’t that better than last time?”
“Only by a little. Gotta consider the margin of error.”
“Whoa, you clever people even speak differently compared with us


common folk.” Itsuki grinned.
“Yeah, yeah.” Amane ignored his friend’s sarcasm and turned back to
the class rankings. He knew Mahiru really gave it her all when it came to
studying. She didn’t like all that effort to show, however, so she worked
tirelessly in secret to make her success look like it came naturally. Others
might’ve praised her or called her a genius, but since they didn’t know
about all the behind-the-scenes struggling, they couldn’t recognize her
actual accomplishments.
That must have been an oppressive way for Mahiru to live.
“...I should at least do something,” Amane whispered.
“Hmm? What’d you say?”
“Nothing. Come on, let’s go back to class.”
“’Kay.”

“Huh? What’s this, Amane?”
Mahiru had gone to the supermarket and returned with dinner
ingredients. When she’d started to put them in the refrigerator, a
conspicuously unfamiliar white box had caught her eye.
“Hmm? Ah, it’s a cake.”
It was likely that Mahiru already had an inkling as to the box’s contents
based on its shape, but she’d gone ahead and asked anyway. Amane had
gone to a patisserie that Chitose talked about a lot on social media to buy
the cake.
“...Do you like cake?” Mahiru asked.
“Not really. I bought it for you.”
“What? Why?”
“I thought it would be nice as a little celebration, because you were top
of our year on the test. It’s to congratulate you.”
Mahiru quickly blinked a few times, unable to process that the cake was
for her. She looked quite taken aback.
“B-but I get top rank every time, so it’s not really something to
celebrate,” she protested.
“Well, you’re always working hard, so I thought it might be nice to get a
reward for once. It’s a shortcake. I hope you like that.”
“Huh? I mean...I don’t hate it or anything...”


“Great. Have some after dinner.”
While Mahiru still looked a bit troubled, Amane cut the conversation off
there. He’d decided that it would be best to act like this was no big deal,
since Mahiru always seemed troubled when people treated her like she was
special.
Mahiru was the type of person who would exhaust herself taking care of
someone else but then neglect herself. Amane had never once seen the girl
do anything enjoyable for her own sake, and whenever anyone praised her
or showed appreciation, she’d just redouble her efforts and run herself
down.
Simply put, Mahiru was not good at accepting kindness from others.
Amane hadn’t known her for all that long, but he was sure that much was
true. That’s why he wanted to return just a little bit of the kindness she was
always showing him.
Amane smiled again as Mahiru got everything ready in the kitchen and
began cooking for that night.
After dinner, Mahiru put the cake on a plate and brought it over to the
coffee table with a nervous expression. Amane couldn’t help but chuckle at
the sight.
“Wh-why are you laughing?”
“Nothing. Don’t worry about it.”
“It doesn’t seem like nothing.”
“It’s fine—stop worrying.”
Amane found it amusing that Mahiru was acting so stiff, but his laughter
clearly bothered her. He was supposed to be showing her some
appreciation, not making fun of her, so Amane quickly shut up.
Mahiru set the cake and the coffee she had brought along with it on the
low table, then sat down on the sofa.
Her movements were still slightly stilted, and Amane felt another fit of
laughter coming on, but Mahiru was sitting next to him now, so he did his
best to quash the temptation.
A shy look in her eyes, Mahiru glanced up at Amane.
“Right, so congratulations,” he said.
“...Thank you very much. But...”
“It’s fine; just enjoy it. You worked hard.”
“That’s true, but...”


“Come on, eat up. Even you should treat yourself to something nice
once in a while.”
The deed was done, and the cake was already here. Mahiru couldn’t
object to that. She gave a small nod before picking up the plate of cake and
a fork.
“Very well, then I will gratefully accept this,” she said.
“Please go ahead.”
With a nimble wave, Mahiru cut the cake into bite-size pieces with her
fork and cautiously tried some. Amane imagined that girls were naturally
very picky about their sweets, but since he’d gotten the cake from one of
Chitose’s favorite shops, he was fairly confident it was a good choice.
He knew his hunch was correct when he saw Mahiru’s eyes widen
slightly when she put the cake in her mouth, then the corners of her mouth
relax slightly. Usually, Mahiru’s expressions really didn’t change all that
much, but recently, she’d become a bit more animated, or perhaps it was
that Amane had gotten better at reading her emotions.
The mellow, carefree face that Mahiru let show as she slowly savored
her cake was one she made only while eating.
“...Hmm? Is something wrong?” She must have noticed Amane staring,
and he quickly looked away.
“No, nothing,” he answered hastily.
Now it was Mahiru’s turn to stare at Amane. Suddenly, she snatched up
the fork again, as if an idea had just struck her. She stabbed one bite of cake
and held it out toward Amane in a suggestive way. In other words, she was
offering to feed him.
“Oh, um...no, thanks, I didn’t really want any,” Amane protested.
“Really?” Mahiru asked.
“...No, well, um...if it’s all right, I guess I’ll have some, but, uh...”
Amane certainly hadn’t expected this development. At a loss, he reflexively
agreed.
A beautiful girl, hand-feeding him cake. For many adolescent boys, it
would be a dream come true. Unfortunately, Amane’s shyness prevented
him from enjoying the situation as much as he would’ve liked.
“You’re the one who bought it in the first place, Amane, so you’ve got
to have some, too.”
Mahiru seemed entirely unaware of any of the implications behind her


gesture. She maintained an ordinary, clueless expression as she held the
cake out toward his mouth.
There was no way he could turn her down, so Amane steeled himself
and bit down.
An incredibly sugary flavor instantly hit him.
“...This is crazy sweet,” he said.
“Well, it is cake.”
That wasn’t what Amane had really been getting at, but Mahiru
remained oblivious.
Sweetness spread through Amane’s mouth as he chewed, but he was too
preoccupied with something else to appreciate the flavor.
“...This really doesn’t seem weird to you, does it?” Amane questioned
in a low voice. He was practically gagging on sweetness and shame, and
Mahiru was acting like this was all quite normal. Amane snatched the fork
from Mahiru’s hand and held out a bite of cake to her in the same way she’d
done for him.
_Turnabout is fair play, right?_
“...Um.” Mahiru hesitated.
“Eat it,” Amane insisted, his tone surprisingly forceful. Mahiru looked
even more confused. Perhaps knowing that she’d started this, she decided to
play along and timidly took a quick bite. The action reminded Amane of a
small bird nipping at something.
Amane stared at Mahiru as she chewed, and gradually, a change came
over her. At first, she’d just looked entirely bewildered, but as her mouth
moved, a slight redness spread across Mahiru’s face. By the time she
swallowed the cake, there was no hiding her obvious embarrassment.
Mahiru’s usually milk-white cheeks now resembled apples, and her eyes
were shimmering, slightly blurred with tears.
“So what do you think?” Amane asked.
“I-it’s d-delicious...”
“Not that. What do you think about being fed?”
Surely Mahiru understood now how Amane had felt earlier, and her eyes
shifted down to look at the floor while she trembled faintly.
“...I feel very much like running away.”
“I bet you do. That’s exactly the sort of thing that might give people the
wrong idea, you know. Save it for your female friends, okay?” Amane


turned away sharply to emphasize his point.
“Okay,” Mahiru replied with a voice that was barely above a whisper.
She’d probably only fed Amane so easily because she trusted him.
Mahiru hadn’t meant any harm by it, of course, but it was still troublesome.
A stubborn sweetness still clung to the inside of Amane’s mouth.
_Guess someone feeling too safe around you can be its own kind of
problem._
In the end, Mahiru curled up into a ball next to Amane, looking slightly
embarrassed as she let a small sigh escape.


Amane usually bought something to eat for lunch at school, but on days off,
that wasn’t possible. He and Mahiru each had their own errands to take care
of, so it was impossible to eat both lunch and dinner together. Even if it had
been doable, Amane would’ve felt supremely guilty asking Mahiru to make
and eat two meals with him.
Usually, Amane only needed to handle his weekend lunches himself, but
if he made too frequent use of the convenience store, Mahiru would scold
him, saying something like “You need to eat a properly balanced diet.” With
the costs of his dinners piling up, Amane also felt awkward about going out
to eat for lunch.
What to do for his midday meal was quickly becoming an issue.
“...I wonder if I should cook something?”
Without any errands that would take Amane out of the house, he sat at
home by himself. Noon was only an hour away.
Mahiru had likely already gotten started making something for herself,
but the same could not be said for her hapless neighbor.
When it came down to it, Amane could make something if he really had
to. It wasn’t like in manga where he’d churn out some censored blob. While
it wouldn’t look particularly fantastic and might not taste spectacular, the
food Amane was capable of creating was edible. It wasn’t exactly cooking,
but it was close enough, and it kept him fed.
The problem was that he’d grown accustomed to Mahiru’s top-rate
meals, so the idea of going back to his own dishes was not particularly


appealing. Nobody would want to go back to such plain fare after sampling
such delicious works of art.
_...Augh, Mahiru really spoils me._
Amane had become a slave to Mahiru’s cooking. He felt ashamed at the
thought of going out to eat again, but he’d also lost interest in convenience-
store meals.
Deciding that he’d been depending on Mahiru too much, Amane
concluded this was a good time to challenge himself. Even though he’d
failed when it came to preparing his own meals thus far.
Mahiru wouldn’t be with him forever, after all. Things between them
were nice and reliable for now, but there were still two years of high school
left, so if anything happened during that time, this relationship of theirs
might come to an abrupt end. What’s more, they would surely go their
separate ways when it came time for college. There was no way things
would simply go on like this indefinitely.
_I guess I’d better try to put in a little effort now, while I still have her
around._
Resolving to do something, even if it was relatively minor, Amane stood
up from the sofa and grabbed his wallet.

“Oh, did you go to the supermarket?”
On his way back from the store, Amane ran into Mahiru in the
apartment lobby. He wasn’t sure if the coincidental meeting was good or
bad. Mahiru looked like she’d also just gone out, because she was carrying
a shopping bag from the nearby stationery store.
“Yeah,” Amane admitted. There was no need to hide it, so Amane
waved his supermarket bags to show her.
With a curious expression, Mahiru asked, “Oh, was the shopping from
yesterday not enough? Didn’t you buy everything on the list?”
“N-no, that’s not it... It’s just...I thought I might try making lunch on
my own,” he said.
“...On your own?”
Despite the explanation, Mahiru’s eyes seemed full of doubt. It was only
natural. Before becoming dependent on Mahiru’s cooking, Amane had
survived by buying premade meals and convenience-store lunches. It must


have been difficult for her to believe that he was really going to cook for
himself.
“I don’t want to say anything mean,” Mahiru continued, “so I’ll just tell
you it would be safer for you to stop now. What if you burn yourself or get
a cut?”
“...You know, it’s not like I literally can’t cook anything at all.”
“Right, it’s just that you can’t cook anything that tastes good. And that’s
assuming you don’t kill yourself in the process.”
Mahiru’s thorough dressing down left Amane speechless. She’d said
exactly what he himself had been thinking.
“If you say you’re going ahead with it, I won’t stop you,” Mahiru said,
“but manage your expectations, or you’ll end up severely disappointed.”
“...Fair enough,” Amane conceded.
By “expectations” she must have been referring to her own cooking.
Mahiru was confident in her abilities, and she was well aware how much
Amane enjoyed her food.
“It’s just that, well, you’re always talking about nutrition and stuff.
There might be some time in the future when I really have to live on my
own, like college. I can’t rely on you forever, right?”
Overdependence on Mahiru only spelled trouble for Amane. After
realizing how much Mahiru had been spoiling him lately, he felt like he
ought to be able to at least manage the basics.
Mahiru’s eyes went wide at Amane’s words, then she let out a sigh that
sounded just the slightest bit impressed.
“...I think it’s a great thing to set your eyes on the future, but if you’re
going to do that, shouldn’t you have come to me first?” she posed.
“Huh?”
“Rather than making whatever kind of mess you’re about to do without
my supervision, it would be much better for me to watch and ensure
nothing goes wrong. Amane, are you confident that you won’t accidentally
destroy your kitchen?”
“...No.” Amane sighed. He knew he made a terrible mess of his kitchen
whenever he tried to use it. With no rebuttal, he gave Mahiru a slow nod.
“It figures,” Mahiru replied stolidly. “That’s why it’s better for me to be
there, right?”
“Would that be asking too much?”


“If I didn’t want to do it, I wouldn’t have suggested the idea.” Her voice
had a bit of a cold edge to it, but since she was agreeing to help him, Amane
didn’t mind. He bowed deeply to express his gratitude.
“You don’t need to be so formal,” Mahiru said, sounding flustered.
Amane smiled, and the two stepped into the elevator, taking it up to their
floor.
“...By the way, do you have an apron?” Mahiru inquired.
“No problems on that front. I bought one for cooking class.”
“And did you use it?”
“There was really no point. All I did was measure ingredients and wash
dishes.”
“Figures.” Mahiru sighed, as if that was exactly what she had suspected.
She accompanied Amane into his apartment. There was actually another
apron already there, one that Mahiru had left behind. Amane would’ve felt
fairly uncomfortable using that one, however.
Donning the apron she kept at Amane’s place, Mahiru gathered her hair
up into a ponytail, like she usually did. Eyes narrowed, she watched Amane
put on the dark-colored apron that he had pulled from the back of a dresser
drawer.
“Wow, I’ve never seen you in that before, Amane. It kind of feels like
the apron’s wearing you.”
“Oh, well, excuuuse me.”
“I guess there’s nothing we can do about that. So you’ve already decided
what you plan to make, right? Since you went and bought the ingredients.”
Mahiru took a peek at the shopping bag that Amane had set on a shelf.
Amane nodded. “Stir-fried vegetables and an omelet.”
“...Veggie stir-fry because I’ve been scolding you to eat more
vegetables and an omelet because you like eggs, right?”
“Bull’s-eye.”
“It’s not like it was a difficult guess. What seasonings do you have for
the stir-fry?”
“This: _yakiniku_ sauce.”
“Oh...straight from the bottle, huh? I suppose it has that robust flavor
that boys like...and I guess it is tasty...”
“It’s better than me trying to make something from scratch, isn’t it?”
If Amane had no _yakiniku_ sauce on hand, he’d planned on whipping up


something that used salt, pepper, and soy sauce instead. Truthfully, he was
glad that he did have the _yakiniku_ sauce. Amane whispered a silent
expression of gratitude for his good fortune of still having a condiment he
could use, then he followed Mahiru’s example and washed his hands.
While he did that, Mahiru was arranging all the necessary utensils and
lining up the ingredients so they would be easy to use. Truly, the angel’s
efficiency knew no bounds.
“For the veggie stir-fry, you just need to cut the vegetables up and fry
them until they’re cooked evenly through, okay? ...Do you know how to
cut them?” Mahiru asked.
“Are you making fun of me?” Amane replied.
It was obvious he knew that much. He wasn’t very good at it, but he
could handle a knife.
Under Mahiru’s careful supervision, Amane began to finely slice up
some cabbage, but he quickly realized how meaningless his earlier words
had been after he cut his own finger.
First Amane had been shown how to do it, and then Mahiru left him to
try on his own while she watched. He’d done fine in the beginning, while
Mahiru was helping him get used to the task, but as soon as she’d left
Amane on his own, he’d slipped up.
“...Owww,” he mumbled, looking down at his finger. It was only a
small cut, but it was bleeding.
The first thing to do was wash it, but of course getting it wet would
sting, too.
“...I thought something like this might happen. Here, give me that.”
Mahiru took a bandage from her apron pocket and skillfully wound it
around Amane’s hurt finger. He was equal parts grateful and impressed.
“You’re very prepared,” he complimented.
“Beginners often hurt themselves.”
“You have no faith in me, do you?” Despite such an accusation, Amane
knew full well that there was no reason for her to think he was even slightly
capable. He’d hurt himself almost immediately, after all.
“I do recognize that you were trying your best,” Mahiru consoled.
“That’s wonderful.”
“Gee, thanks.”
“I still would have liked you to ask me ahead of time, though.”


“You say that, but it would’ve been awful to make you cook lunch for
me, too, especially on a weekend.”
“I know you’re trying to handle things by yourself, but if you mess up
and it becomes a whole situation that ends with calling me anyway... It
would be easier to have just been here from the start.”
“Fine.”
This time, Amane had gotten away with only a light injury, but if some
terrible kitchen disaster had happened instead, or if he had used some
appliance wrong and it stopped working, he knew he wouldn’t have been
able to deal with it on his own. Mahiru was absolutely right.
“...And please don’t ever try to fry anything. You’ll start a fire,” she
added.
“I’m nowhere near advanced enough to make fried food,” Amane
admitted.
“I don’t think it’s actually quite that difficult... Once again, I’m forced
to wonder how you survived on your own all this time,” Mahiru quipped.
“Sorry about all this,” Amane replied in a sulky voice. “Now you know
why I was living on convenience-store food.”
Mahiru looked at him with concern on her face. Amane wasn’t
particularly disheartened or angry, so she had nothing to worry about, but
Mahiru cast her eyes downward, seemingly a little troubled about
something anyway.
“...It’s just—I’m scared of the idea of you making fried foods, Amane,
so if you really want some, please come ask me instead.”
“All right then, tomorrow I want to eat fried mince cutlets.” Immediately
recovering his good humor, Amane was already putting in a request for the
next day’s dinner. Mahiru gave a small, relieved sigh once she heard that.
“All right, but you’re eating plenty of cabbage salad on the side. And
I’m making miso soup with lots of vegetables, got it?”
“Yeah, yeah. And...thank you.”
“For what?”
“For everything.”
Mahiru did so much for Amane every day and still found time to worry
about him. Amane was truly grateful, even if he sometimes said stupid,
hurtful things. He wasn’t sure where he’d be without her. Admitting as
much felt a little embarrassing, though.


“You help me a lot,” he murmured very quietly. He then promptly turned
back to the vegetables.

“Let’s eat.”
“Sounds good.”
Grappling with the vegetables had taken nearly an hour, but it had been
worth it. On the table was a stir-fry made from clumsily cut greens, a
beautifully shaped omelet...and a pile of scrambled eggs.
Naturally, the beautiful omelet was one Mahiru had made in an attempt
to provide Amane with something to use as a reference. While Amane had
tried his best to make a second omelet, he’d ended up with scrambled eggs
instead.
The failed attempt was set in front of Mahiru so she could evaluate his
work. The picture-perfect example, the platonic ideal of omelets, had been
prepared for Amane.
After pressing her hands together in thanks for the food, Mahiru grabbed
a piece of the tattered eggs with her chopsticks to check the taste.
“...It’s flavorless scrambled eggs, all right. Didn’t you add any salt or
pepper?”
“I forgot. Plus, I was supposed to be making an omelet.”
“You scrambled it up too much. What were you thinking, mixing it with
the chopsticks until it fell apart? I warned you about that.”
“Sorry.”
Amane had forgotten to add the seasonings because he’d mixed up his
egg while Mahiru was making her omelet. Otherwise, he’d been under
careful supervision throughout the whole process. The lacking flavor and
shape of his eggs was clearly Amane’s own fault.
On the other hand, Mahiru’s dish was soft, fluffy, and unspeakably
delicious. The difference between them was night and day.
“...I think, for you, it was a really good attempt. The most important
thing is that you tried. Still, I’m worried that if I let you try it on your own,
the cleanup afterward will be awful, so I’d like you to take it slow, okay?”
Mahiru asked.
“...I’m going to become totally reliant on you,” Amane replied.
“It’s a little late for that.”


“Ugh...”
“Just joking. Well, not really, but I like that you appreciate my cooking,
and I don’t hate teaching you to cook, either, so...really, you don’t have to
worry.”
“...Thanks again—for everything.”
It was really thanks to Mahiru’s kindness that Amane was able to live as
well as he was. He owed her quite a bit, but he knew that Mahiru would
hate it if he groveled too much, so he held his head high.
Curiously, Mahiru was wearing a slightly lonesome expression as she
said, “If you do learn how to cook, Amane, I guess I’ll be relieved of my
duties.”
It was certainly true that when Amane learned to fix his own meals,
there would be no need for Mahiru to do it for him anymore, but Amane
shook his head.
“No, that’s... I mean... Your cooking is the best, Mahiru, so please... I
want to keep eating it for as long as I can. Though, I guess that’s kinda
shameless of me to ask.”
Amane would never have denied it was selfish of him to want Mahiru to
continue cooking for him, but at the same time, her food was obviously
leagues better than his, and he couldn’t turn it away. The addiction had long
since set in, and Amane was terrified of being cut off.
Mahiru’s eyes widened at the humble plea, and she smiled slightly. The
vague tinge of loneliness vanished in an instant.
“Ha-ha. You really are hopeless, aren’t you? Well, I don’t intend to stop,
so you can relax.”
“...Thanks,” Amane said, feeling relieved that the shade of anxiety he’d
seen on her face was gone, replaced with a faint smile.
“How about I get you to help me out sometimes? Peeling vegetables,
measuring ingredients, things like that,” Mahiru proposed.
“Like a kid helping in the kitchen.”
“Amane, that’s where you need to start, you know?”
Since Amane’s skill level truly was on par with a child’s, there was
really nothing he could say back. Mahiru looked amused.


“Hey, Amane, can we have a Christmas party at your place?”
“Nope.”
The proposal had been immediately shot down, and Chitose puffed out
her cheeks to make her disappointment obvious.
Christmas Eve was fast approaching, but since Amane lived separately
from his family and was a loner by nature, the holiday didn’t hold any real
significance. Still, Chitose and Itsuki seemed keen on spending it with him
and had come to ask him about holding a little celebration.
Chitose had gone out of her way to barge into Amane and Itsuki’s
classroom at lunchtime with the idea, and now she had her cheeks puffed
out because of Amane’s near-instant refusal.
“Come on, Amane,” Itsuki angled. “You’re alone anyway...ah, unless
maybe there’s a girlfriend in the picture?”
“No, there isn’t.”
“Well then, it’s fine!” Chitose interjected. “Or could it be that you
secretly hate us?”
“Well, if Amane hates us, then I guess we don’t need him, either,” Itsuki
added.
In their own way, his friends were probably expressing their concern for
him. There was also the possibility that they were hunting for a place where
they could relax and flirt. Amane felt bad about refusing them, even when
they made such exaggeratedly disappointed faces at him. He didn’t actually
hate them.
That was not to say Amane had no concerns, however. First was the


thought of how the two of them would act in a private setting. Amane could
feel the embarrassment washing over him at the mere thought of Itsuki and
Chitose’s shameless intimacy. Then there was the fact that he would have to
explain things to Mahiru. She would have to steer clear until Amane’s
friends left, and he would have to be very careful about covering up any
evidence of her frequent visits.
“Fine. I get it, I get it. The twenty-fourth, right? I have a condition,
though: You have to set me free before nightfall and go somewhere else
together to get all your flirting done. I’ll remind you that excessive physical
contact is prohibited in my apartment.” With Amane’s concession to the
couple’s demands, Chitose’s face lit up with a smile.
“Guess there’s nothing we can do about that rule. I’m sure we can work
something out,” she said.
“Who do you think you are to say such entitled things?” Amane quickly
grabbed one of Chitose’s cheeks and pinched.
“Owwsh!” she slurred. “Itsukiii, Amane’s buwwyying me!”
“Come on, Amane, don’t be mean to Chi! I’m the only one who’s
allowed to pinch her cheeks,” Itsuki said.
“Fine, fine; pinch her real good for me, then,” Amane replied.
“Leave it to me.”
“Don’t you dare!” Chitose cried.
Amane entrusted Itsuki to carry out the sentence, but as one might’ve
expected, he and Chitose turned it into just another excuse to flirt. Within
moments, the two of them started messing around, playfully pinching each
other’s faces.
Now Chitose actually looked happy to be pinched.
Amane shrugged. “...Can I go?”
This was Amane’s classroom, but he wanted to get some distance from
the lovey-dovey couple before they got any more insufferable.
“No way! We’ve got to make proper plans. We need to arrange for food
and a cake!”
“I’m not making anything.”
There was no way Amane could fix a Christmas meal. Mahiru could
handle it, no problem, but there was absolutely no way he could get her
help this time. That’s why Amane quickly brushed off the idea, insisting
that it would be impossible for him to cook. Chitose didn’t seem convinced,


however, and was staring at him strangely.
“What?” Amane asked.
“I was just thinking you look awfully healthy for someone who can’t
cook,” Chitose said.
“So? What’s the problem?”
“Well, you see, Chi, Amane’s got his own reasons for that,” Itsuki
commented.
“Huh, well, don’t you want to know about them, too, Itsuki?”
“I’ll get him to spill later.”
“I’m not telling you a thing.”
Amane glared at Itsuki as if to tell him not to make promises he couldn’t
keep, and he laughed out loud, in a forced way. Itsuki knew when to let
things go, but he had a bad habit of dredging up old stuff at rather
inopportune times.
“You guys are a real handful...,” Amane muttered. “Well, for dinner,
can’t we get takeout or something? We’ll have to order the cake if we want
one.” Attempting to move away from his own affairs that the couple
seemed so eager to pry into, he made a pragmatic proposal.
There was no way he could make a cake or prepare a meal on his own,
so arranging for ready-made food seemed to be the way to go.
“Ah, all right then, let’s have pizza! I’ll book a cake from my usual
place; they’re still taking orders!” Chitose declared.
“You don’t want chicken?” asked her boyfriend.
“You like pizza better, too, don’t you, Itsuki?”
“True, true. That’s my Chi; you know me best.”
“Eh-heh-heh...”
While the two lovebirds had decided on what to get without discussing it
at all with Amane, he was fine with pizza. Something like that made it feel
more like a party anyway. Given the way things were going, they would
probably pick up some takeaway pizzas from the shop that Amane and
Itsuki often visited.
The moment Amane heard the word _pizza_ , he thought of Mahiru—and
when she’d nibbled her pizza like a small animal. Amane had found it
strangely charming, probably because he usually saw her eating so
elegantly. Come to think of it, he’d gotten Mahiru to eat cake the other day,
too. Amane’s cheeks glowed warmly as he remembered that.


_I won’t do anything like that again_ , Amane vowed to himself.
It’d been so embarrassing to feed each other; there was no way Amane
could endure a repeat of that. Mahiru and Amane weren’t some affectionate
couple like Itsuki and Chitose, so the opportunity should never come up
again anyway.
“...Hey, Amane, what’s up?”
“Oh, no, nothing. All right, we’ll leave the cake order up to you.”
Amane had drifted back into some embarrassing memories for a
moment, and Chitose had started staring at him with a concerned
expression, puzzled. Panicking, Amane chased the flustering thoughts from
his head and did his best to be casual.
“All right! Let’s get our pizza order in, too!” he said, a bit more worked
up than usual.
With Chitose’s excitable voice still ringing in his ears, Amane returned
home and decided to ask Mahiru about her Christmas plans.

“Christmas plans? I don’t really have any,” Mahiru replied quickly from her
place on the sofa. Amane had posed the question after finishing the dishes
and joining her in the living room. He’d been confident Mahiru would be
going to a girls’ party, but apparently, she didn’t have anything lined up.
Maybe Amane’s surprise showed, because Mahiru made an annoyed face at
him.
“Basically, all the girls I know and most of my female classmates have
boyfriends to go out with. And I always turn down all the boys who invite
me out, so my schedule is totally open,” she explained.
“Breaking all the hearts, huh?”
Whenever she was out in public, Mahiru kept her guard up, and any
hopeful suitors were sure to end up drowning in their own tears when faced
with the angel’s impregnable defenses.
Still, Amane had to respect anyone who had the guts to ask Mahiru out.
No one would be able to do such a thing without a huge amount of self-
confidence, and Amane admired those optimistic types.
“...I wonder why boys want to spend Christmas with me so badly
anyway?” Mahiru wondered aloud.
“They’re probably hoping to get to know you better,” Amane explained.


“What for?”
“I mean, because they want to date you?”
“And why would they want to date me?”
“...Probably to do all the sorts of... _things_ that dating people do.”
“How obscene.”
Amane offered a silent prayer for all the guys who’d just been ruthlessly
discarded. “Well, I don’t think every one of them is like that, so don’t be too
distrustful. I’m sure you understand that you’re the sort of girl who draws
all their eyes.”
“You’re right. It’s unlikely that all of them are harboring lewd thoughts.
After all, you aren’t like that, are you, Amane?”
“Have I ever treated you that way?” Amane had certainly thought
Mahiru looked cute, or that he wanted to rub her head, but he’d never gone
so far as to fantasize about being intimate with her. If such things ever did
cross his mind, Amane was sure that Mahiru would likely notice and pull
away from him.
It was only because Mahiru saw Amane as a harmless puppy that he
could sit there next to her. Baring so much as a single fang could be enough
to send her running away. The needs of Amane’s stomach ranked higher in
his mind than other appetites, so he had no intention of jeopardizing his
relationship with Mahiru.
“I suppose you’re right. You never seemed to have any interest in me
from the beginning, Amane.”
“Mm-hmm.”
“That’s why I trust you.”
“Well, thanks for that.”
As a guy, Amane wasn’t sure how he felt about Mahiru’s reasons for
trusting him, but for the time being, he decided he was okay with being the
“safe guy.”
“...So, Amane, did you have something in mind when you asked me
about my Christmas plans?” Mahiru inquired.
“Hmm? Oh, on the afternoon of the twenty-fourth, Itsuki and Chitose
are coming over, so I thought I would let you know that, uh, our usual
dinner might have to start late.”
Having returned to the original topic of conversation, Amane carefully
explained the situation while Mahiru nodded along.


“I understand. Please call me once your Christmas party is over, and I’ll
make dinner then. I’ll try to take care of the prep work ahead of time,”
Mahiru said.
“Sure; sorry about all that.”
“It’s fine. Have fun.”
“...You won’t be lonely?”
“I’m used to spending Christmas alone.”
Mahiru’s casual attitude about spending the holiday alone struck Amane
as rather depressing. Perhaps thoughts of Christmas had reminded Mahiru
of her parents, because a small, self-deprecating laugh slipped out.
“...Ah, um, this is really presumptuous of me to say, but...even if I can’t
do Christmas Eve, how about we spend Christmas Day together?” Amane
felt extremely awkward making this sort of suggestion. He didn’t have any
particular ulterior motive, but two people getting together on the holiday
usually did carry a certain implication.
_There’s no special meaning to this_ , Amane told himself. It was just that
he hated when Mahiru looked so lonely; that was all.
Surprised, Mahiru blinked quickly at the suggestion. “Together? Doing
what?” she asked.
“Huh? Ah, well, I didn’t really have anything in mind. Sorry.” Now that
it was obvious he didn’t have a plan, Amane figured he should drop the
issue. There was also the consideration that going out together meant there
was a risk of being spotted by someone from school. That would be a huge
problem for Amane and Mahiru both.
The best option would be spending time at home, but there was probably
nothing in Amane’s apartment that would interest Mahiru. It would likely
boil down to just sitting next to each other, doing nothing, which would
probably be incredibly awkward.
If that’s all Amane could offer, he suspected it was probably better to
just spend the day apart. As he prepared to withdraw his proposal, he
noticed that Mahiru was staring at him quietly.
“...Okay. I’d like to try that,” It was unexpected, but Mahiru actually
seemed interested.
Her slim finger was pointing at the television. To be more precise, she
was pointing at the game console housed inside the TV stand.
Recently, Mahiru had been visiting in the evenings, so Amane hadn’t


booted up the system much, but it seemed like Mahiru was curious about it.
“I’ve never used one of those things...,” she confessed in a small voice.
Amane didn’t have any concrete reason to refuse Mahiru if she wanted
to try playing games, but the thought of a guy and girl who weren’t dating
or anything spending Christmas day together playing video games was
somewhat surreal. Even if he wasn’t hoping for anything romantic, it was
only natural that the idea gave rise to a confusing mix of emotions.
“Oh, well, that’d be fine, but...is that okay? To spend the day gaming?”
Amane asked.
“Is there anything wrong with that?” Mahiru replied with her own
question.
“I guess not, but...”
“Well, then let’s go with that.”
“S-sure.”
_Great, I guess that’s what we’re doing..._
Since it was what Mahiru wanted, Amane resolved himself to do
everything he could to make sure it happened. He wanted to at least give
her this modest bit of enjoyment. Mahiru was always taking care of him,
and she hardly ever asked for anything, so he would let her play anything
she wanted, as long as he had it in his collection. It wasn’t like he had any
plans on Christmas Day anyway, so this was a small price indeed for
Mahiru’s fantastic cooking.
“All right, we can have a laid-back day that doesn’t have anything to do
with Christmas or whatever,” Amane declared.
“Then it’s decided,” Mahiru answered.
Amane found it difficult to look directly at Mahiru’s smiling face, so
instead he nodded and turned away while doing his best to look casual.

“Merry Christmas!”
Christmas Eve arrived before too long.
School had already let out for winter break, and everyone was probably
spending the day enjoying themselves. Itsuki and Chitose had shown up at
Amane’s apartment, party supplies in hand, at around one in the afternoon.
On the table, the pizza and juice they had ordered for delivery were
already laid out. The three had actually planned to meet up a bit earlier, but


the Christmas crowds had slowed everything down and put them all behind
schedule. Thankfully, it was only an hour past noon, and Amane hadn’t
been waiting too long, so no one seemed all that bothered.
“Yeah, yeah, Merry Christmas,” Amane replied.
“Amane, you don’t sound very excited! Try again,” Chitose instructed.
“Merry Christmas!”
“You’re saying the words just fine, but you’re not really in the spirit, are
you?”
Amane didn’t like to be compared to Chitose, who was very excitable by
nature.
Realizing that she was even more worked up than usual, Itsuki did his
best to placate Chitose. He flashed a flippant, yet still-warm smile at his
girlfriend.
“Come on, we don’t need to worry about that. Let’s get to the eating part
and the having-a-good-time part and then the falling-asleep part,” said
Itsuki.
“You can’t sleep here, idiot,” Amane snapped.
“I’m just kidding, geez. Besides, if I am gonna sleep, I’m going to Chi’s
place.”
“You’ll have to do that when her parents aren’t around.”
“Huh, Amaneee! What kind of perverted things are you thinking?!” Chi
cried. She was grinning, but Amane didn’t respond. Instead, he made for the
kitchen to grab some cups and utensils. Pouting, Chitose looked briefly
disappointed at this lack of reaction but then quickly followed after him,
shouting that she would help.
The kitchen was, naturally, neat and tidy, with everything in order.
Mahiru had made it her territory as of late, so all the various tools and
seasonings were lined up for easy access.
“Whoa, this is way cleaner than I expected,” Chitose commented.
“Thanks a lot,” Amane responded idly. He took small plates for
individual portions and some cups out of a kitchen cupboard. When he tried
to hand half to Chitose, he found her staring fixedly at the cupboard.
“...What is it?” Amane asked.
“Nothing!” she answered hurriedly.
Amane felt something devious behind Chitose’s sly smile, and a shiver
shot down his back. The best course of action for the time being was to


ignore her entirely, however, so Amane did his best to act like nothing was
wrong. He had a terrible feeling Chitose was brewing up some elaborate
misconception, but since she hadn’t said anything, Amane wasn’t sure what
it could be.
Grimacing, Amane and Chitose returned to the living room where Itsuki
was waiting. It was becoming abundantly clear that Chitose was in an even
better mood than when she’d first arrived.
“Seriously, though, your apartment is super clean. It’s so big and
luxurious,” Chitose muttered. The three friends had mostly finished eating.
They’d been listening to Christmas music through the speakers in the living
room.
There was little Amane could say in response to Chitose’s comment. He
was living in a nice apartment because his parents were paying for it, and
the place was only this clean because Mahiru had helped him keep it that
way. After considering that, all Amane could say was “Yeah, thanks.”
“It’s definitely impressive how much better the place looks now that it’s
clean...,” Itsuki remarked.
“Shut up...,” Amane shot back.
“Yep, yep, I smell a girl!” Chitose added.
“How did you make that jump?” Amane had no idea how Chitose made
the connection between his clean apartment and a feminine presence.
“Hmm? Call it a woman’s intuition. The way everything’s arranged is a
little off for you, personality-wise. There’s something about the way the
books are lined up and how the cords are all gathered to keep them from
getting tangled or torn. Plus, there are all sorts of cooking implements in the
kitchen that seem like they really don’t belong to you, Amane.”
“...They’re my mom’s,” Amane lied.
“Hmm?”
Preemptively, Amane had shoved all of Mahiru’s things into the back of
a cabinet, but Chitose must have caught sight of them when Amane had
been getting the plates.
Amane’s tableware alone hadn’t been enough, so Mahiru had brought a
few things over from her place, but Amane hadn’t expected Chitose to
notice. For better or worse, she was not the kind of person who usually paid
attention to such details.
“Well, it’s not like we care that much, right, Itsuki?” Amane’s reply had


been suspiciously slow. Sensing a deeper meaning in that, Chitose leaned
over to Itsuki, grinning.
Casually, and without a hint of hesitation, Itsuki reached over and rested
his hand between Chitose’s knees as he embraced her. It was getting
extremely difficult to look directly at the couple.
“Hey, why don’t you get a room, you two?!” Amane shouted.
“Oh, you jealous, Amane?” Itsuki asked.
“Psh, yeah right.”
Rather than any sort of envy, Amane just wanted them out of his sight.
He wished they would stop, but this sort of behavior was business as usual
for the couple. Scolding them for it was a waste of energy at this point.
Looking very satisfied with herself as she clung to Itsuki, Chitose leaned
against his chest and looked up at Itsuki’s face. “...I bet everyone’s flirting
at their own parties right about now.”
“Hey, don’t forget you’ve got a guy right here crying bitter tears of
loneliness,” said Amane.
_There’s no way_ everyone _is acting like these two._
There had to be some people who were spending the holiday with family
—and others who were spending it with friends. Surely there were even
some spending the holiday completely alone. Amane felt like Chitose ought
to choose her words more carefully. Not everyone was lucky enough to
spend Christmas with other people.
“Do boys really want sweethearts that badly?” Chitose asked.
“I don’t think they do,” Amane answered flatly. “I certainly don’t.”
“Yeah, but...,” Itsuki interjected, “you’re an outlier.”
“Shut up.”
“Well, everyone gets restless right before Christmas, you know,” Chitose
continued. “Especially single guys. The other day, I asked the angel about
her Christmas plans and found out she’d ruthlessly rejected just about every
boy in school. She left ’em all brokenhearted because she supposedly
already made plans with someone else.”
“Huh,” Itsuki said.
Amane had a feeling that someone was him. The idea that he was little
more than a diplomatic excuse to turn down other dates wasn’t a pleasant
one, but he knew that it pained Mahiru to have to refuse anyone. If having
plans with Amane helped ease Mahiru’s conscience, then he supposed he


couldn’t object. After all, she wasn’t giving his name out, so there shouldn’t
be any trouble.
“All those poor boys looked so crushed. It was rude, but I laughed,”
Chitose recalled.
“You shouldn’t laugh!” Itsuki scolded playfully.
“I mean, using a holiday as an excuse to try to score a date with a girl
you barely know is total crap, isn’t it? They’re already off to a late start
’cause they haven’t built any kind of relationship, so they try to take a
convenient little shortcut to get to where they really want to be. Plus, I bet
those guys are the kind who’d say they were taking her to a party with a lot
of people but then create some excuse to be alone with her. It’s a scary
thing, for a girl.”
Chitose went on to add that the angel was certainly not the type to go
along with those kinds of games anyway, then stuck out her tongue and
clung to Itsuki even more, as if she’d touched on an unpleasant memory.
Trendy and beautiful, Chitose had a different look than Mahiru. It wouldn’t
have been surprising to learn that she’d had some bad experiences with
guys in the past. Amane felt a little sorry for her. Popular girls certainly had
it rough.
“It must be hard on Shiina, dealing with all those propositions,” Amane
said suddenly.
“...You’re really not interested in the angel, are you, Amane?” Itsuki
asked.
“Not really,” Amane replied flatly.
“You already have that angelic next-door neighbor of yours, huh?”
Chitose needled.
“Don’t think I won’t kick you out of my apartment...”
“No, don’t! I’m sooo scaaared!” Chitose whined, clinging to Itsuki as
she playfully glared at Amane. “So you’re not denying that your neighbor
has been taking care of you, right?”
Amane’s words stuck in his throat, and Chitose grinned with smug
satisfaction, though her expression quickly changed when she saw his face.
“Don’t glare at me like that! Sorry, geez...” Chitose apologized in a tone
that held very little remorse. When Amane narrowed his eyes at her a
second time, she gave a cutesy shriek and clung to Itsuki again. Then she
happened to look through the window behind her boyfriend.


Something outside was surprising enough for her to stare, so Amane
also followed her gaze and looked at the window, wondering what was
going on. Little white flecks were wafting down from the blue sky.
“...Ah, Itsuki, look! Snow!” Chitose cried.
“Whoa, a white Christmas!”
Snow wasn’t that unusual at the end of December, but it was rare to see
any on such a clear day, and it seemed to delight the lovebirds.
It was still daytime, and the temperature was only going to drop as the
sun began to set. Christmas Eve was likely to be blanketed in snow this
year. Couples all over town were likely rejoicing, and the couple in
Amane’s apartment had already stepped out onto his balcony for a better
view.
“I’m sure you’re going to be making out over there for a while, so I’ll
fix you some warm drinks,” Amane shouted as he watched Itsuki and
Chitose head outside. As Amane was standing up, a hysterical shriek
suddenly caught his ear.
“Huh?! Wh-why are you here?”
“Huh, what?”
“Ah.”
The last voice in the bunch was one Amane had only become
accustomed to hearing relatively recently. It rang clear and sweet.
Amane felt his stomach sink.
Aware that Itsuki and Chitose were huddling together on his veranda,
Amane dashed out in a panic and saw that Mahiru had also come out onto
her own balcony to look at the snow. In doing so, she had been spotted by
Amane’s friends the moment she’d leaned over the railing.

Amane looked at Mahiru, who was now sitting beside him, and sighed.
Faced with the terrible disaster of everyone encountering each other on
the balconies, Amane had been left with no other option but to invite
Mahiru into his apartment.
No matter what Amane tried now, his two friends would definitely be
suspicious. At this point, telling them the whole truth was probably the only
way to avoid unnecessary speculations and misunderstandings. Things were
bound to get worse if he couldn’t keep Itsuki and Chitose quiet about this,


too.
“...Um, I really am sorry,” Mahiru said gently.
“You didn’t do anything wrong.”
It was a white Christmas and also the first snow of the year. Of course
Mahiru had gone to her veranda to take a look. No one could’ve blamed
her.
If Amane had heard the sound of her opening her glass door, he might
have been able to do something, but there’d been music playing in the
apartment, so he hadn’t noticed. Mahiru had likely been trying to stay quiet
anyway.



Chitose was staring at Amane and Mahiru as they reflected on their
carelessness, and her eyes sparkled as she leaned in close. “So Amane’s
next-door neighbor was the angel all along?!”
“Um, please don’t call me that...” True to form, Mahiru hated being
called an angel to her face and politely objected to the nickname, but
Chitose was grinning from ear to ear, and it wasn’t clear whether she was
listening.
Itsuki, meanwhile, scratched his cheek and looked back and forth
between Amane and Mahiru, eyebrows raised. “Wow. So...just to recap,
Shiina lives next door, and she’s been making you meals this whole time. Is
that about right?”
“...Yeah,” Amane admitted.
“W-well...um, I had a favor to repay, and I could tell by looking at him
that Fujimiya was not eating well, and that bothered me, so...”
The two tried their best to explain how they first met and why they’d
continued seeing each other. Itsuki acted like he understood but still wore
an expression like he didn’t quite comprehend it.
Amane thought that if he were in Itsuki’s position, he probably wouldn’t
be able to grasp the whole story, either. Who would believe that an
incredible girl like Mahiru would so casually decide to start caring for an
unremarkable slob like Amane?
“Hmm, so I think I understand the situation, but what’s really strange
about all this is the idea that you don’t have any ulterior motives toward
Amane, Shiina. Like, you’re basically acting as if you’re his part-time
wife,” said Itsuki.
“Guh!” Amane sputtered in surprise.
_Wife?_
Amane wouldn’t have chosen such a word, but he had to admit that their
current interactions did somewhat resemble that sort of relationship. Mahiru
made him dinner every night and had even treated him to lunch on a recent
weekend. On top of that, she sometimes helped him with cleaning. On the
surface, it wasn’t too far off from stereotypical married life. The important
distinction was that neither Amane nor Mahiru harbored any romantic
feelings for the other.
Mahiru’s eyes had also widened slightly at Itsuki’s assessment, but she
very quickly recovered from the shock, and Amane could see her slipping


into her cordial public persona. “I can assure you that I have no such
intentions whatsoever.”
Amane realized that she was handling Itsuki and Chitose the same way
she handled everyone else at school. Suddenly, he felt extremely
embarrassed.
“It’s perfectly innocent,” Amane added. “Shiina is just helping me out,
okay?”
“If you say so, Amane. It’s just... What a strange pairing. It’s really a bit
hard to swallow that such an incredible girl is cooking for you... Hey, that
stuffed animal you bought, was that also for her?”
“...Maybe,” Amane conceded.
“Whaaa—?!” Chitose broke into a shout.
“Oh, be quiet.”
“I haven’t said anything yet, though?”
“Your face is loud enough.”
“Rude!”
Chitose’s smirk was irritating. She looked incredibly pleased with
herself for having “solved” this mystery. Up to this point, the conversation
had proceeded without much teasing, and Amane was grateful for that. He
certainly didn’t need any unnecessary prodding right now, and Mahiru
likely wouldn’t be thrilled by the idea, either. Amane had been hoping that
Chitose would keep her mouth shut.
“Come on now; calm down, both of you.” Itsuki put a stop to things
before they really got out of hand. He’d picked up on the change in
Amane’s demeanor and was not the type to poke fun at his friend like
Chitose would. Itsuki was the kind of guy who was sensitive to how people
felt. Of course, Amane wished he’d stopped before prying in the first place,
but that ship had sailed.
After scolding Amane and Chitose, Itsuki turned back to Mahiru, who
was sitting stiffly on the sidelines, and bowed his head. “...Um, Shiina,
thank you for taking care of our Amane.”
“Since when did I become your kid?”
“I should be thanking you, for being such dear friends to Fujimiya,”
Mahiru answered gracefully.
“C’mon, not you, too! You’re making me sound like a worthless jerk.”
“You kinda are, though,” Itsuki remarked.


“Hey, screw you.”
He’d heard Itsuki say things like that to him before, but Amane was
hardly in the mood right now. Mahiru could have joined in the banter, but
she wisely kept silent and smiled, content to watch the exchange between
the two boys. She wasn’t being quite as expressive as she was when she
was alone with Amane, but that smile lifted the veil on her usual act just a
little bit. Perhaps noticing, Itsuki looked befuddled.
Amane made a crack about Itsuki checking her out despite his being
taken, and Chitose started pouting and laid into Amane even harder. It was
kind of funny, but Mahiru had her head tilted in bemusement, so Amane
downplayed his enjoyment and assumed a more relaxed pose.
“...All right, look. We don’t have a mushy-sweet relationship like you
guys do, but I still need you both to understand that this could get really
hairy if word got out,” said Amane.
“Got it; say nothing to nobody.” Evidently picking up on his friend’s
attempts to point out the potential danger, Itsuki quickly nodded in
understanding, much to Amane’s surprise.
“You too, Chitose,” Amane added.
“I’m not that much of a chatterbox, you know. Besides, no one would
believe that such a cute girl is making dinner and stuff for you of all
people.”
“Well, excuse me for being so undeserving...,” Amane muttered.
“Geez, I didn’t mean it like that!”
Amane was well aware that what Chitose was saying was true. It was
difficult to accept that the star of the school was taking care of an ordinary
schlub like him. If anyone did believe the story, they’d probably curse
Amane’s very name for being so undeserving of Mahiru’s angelic attention.
Amane was particularly imaginative when it came to visualizing that last
part, which was why he really didn’t want the truth about their relationship
getting out. He could do without all the trouble.
Chitose laughed at Amane’s sudden humility. Then her gaze shifted to
Mahiru, as if her eye had been drawn to something. Chitose let out a heavy
sigh as she stared longingly at the other girl. Mahiru quickly turned
uncomfortable, like she wasn’t sure what to do.
“Um, what is it?” she asked.
“...It just struck me all over again. Shiina, you’re ridiculously cute,


aren’t you?”
“Huh? Thank you very much...?”
Having praised Mahiru right to her face, Chitose continued to stare,
scrutinizing every last bit of her.
“This is my first time seeing you so close-up, but sure enough, you
really are as beautiful as an angel, aren’t you? Your face has a nice shape,
and your skin is lovely and creamy. Plus, your eyelashes are long, your hair
is smooth, and you’re slim but still curvy!”
“Uh, um...?” Mahiru managed, flustered.
Amane sighed deeply. He couldn’t deal with Chitose when she got like
this. While the girl definitely had her merits, there sure were some things he
couldn’t stand about her. He couldn’t put up with her high-energy
personality or the fact that she was always butting into other people’s
business.
Amane had a particular appreciation for how difficult she could be
because he had someone similar in his family. It was all the ways in which
Chitose reminded him of his mother that really drove him crazy.
Undeniably, Chitose resembled Amane’s mother in taste and disposition;
she was obsessed with cute things.
“Wow, seriously, looking closely, you’re an incredible beauty—and so
cute! Hey, hey, can I touch your hair? I mean, do you have a secret to
getting your hair so smooth and shiny? What shampoo and conditioner do
you use?” Chitose pressed.
“Wait, ah, um...so sudden...,” Mahiru stammered.
“Your skin’s so soft, too. What kind of regimen do you follow to keep it
like this?”
Chitose, who seemed caught between a desire to share beauty secrets
and a want to poke and prod at the beautiful girl, stretched out a hand
toward Mahiru as she bombarded her with questions.
Amane felt sorry for Mahiru, who, despite her discomfort, was
powerless against the onslaught. Cursing under his breath, Amane lightly
bonked Chitose on the head. It was a just a tap, since the goal was simply to
get Chitose to cool her heels, but she’d apparently been caught by surprise
as she cried “Oww!” and drew her hand back away from Mahiru. As for
Mahiru, she seemed relieved by Amane’s intercession. He’d forgotten about
it because she was conducting herself with her usual angelic poise, but


Mahiru was extremely wary around people she wasn’t used to. Chitose was
a girl, so Mahiru wasn’t as wary as she had been with Amane, but her fear
of strangers was still quite clear.
“I can’t believe you did that!” Chitose whined.
“She’s shy, and you’ve only just met her, so stop trying to touch her,”
Amane chided.
“I can touch her once we get to know each other?”
“You’ll need to ask Shiina about that. Be respectful.”
Mahiru had obviously been getting ready to make a run for it. It was a
good thing he’d stepped in. Even Chitose seemed to understand why she
should stop when she saw how clearly shaken Mahiru was.
“I’m sorry; I got too excited and almost did something without asking,”
Chitose apologized.
“Ah, mm-hmm...” Mahiru still seemed upset by the close call, and she
looked at Amane as if she didn’t know what to do, her eyes pleading for
help.
“Uh, Shiina, Chitose can be sorta a handful, but she’s not a bad person...
I think,” Amane explained.
“Is that supposed to be a compliment?” the excitable girl snapped.
“Look at the way you were acting. Can you really argue?”
“Nope!”
Chitose, having just openly disavowed her own actions, stared at Mahiru
for a moment, then once again extended a hand toward her, wearing a very
serious expression.
“In that case, it’s a pleasure to make your acquaintance!” This time,
however, she presented Mahiru with an open hand.
“Huh? Y-yeah, nice to meet you...” Mahiru hesitantly accepted the
handshake.
Once Chitose took a liking to someone, Amane knew she was
determined to be their friend, whether they wanted it or not. Something told
Amane that Mahiru would be swayed by Chitose’s persistence. Really, as
long as she didn’t do anything too weird in her pursuit of Mahiru’s
friendship, Amane didn’t mind. An ordinary, low-key relationship was best.
“First impressions are so important for becoming good friends, you
know! You probably already know who I am, and I’m sure you’ve heard my
name from Amane, but I’m Chitose Shirakawa. I’m Itsuki’s girlfriend. I


guess you could call him...Amane’s best friend?”
“Oh my, I’m blushing! A best friend, wow,” Itsuki ribbed.
“Don’t act so flattered, Itsuki; it’s weird,” Amane shot back.
“There you go again... Hey, Amane, they’ve got a name for people like
you, y’know...sweet and sour!”
“I’ll seriously kick you out.”
“Forcing us outside in the snow? Oh, how cruel!”
“Don’t try to wheedle your way out of this one.”
Itsuki cackled with laughter, and Amane looked even more annoyed.
Mahiru’s eyes went wide as she watched their exchange.
“Oh, we always act like this,” Itsuki informed her as he smiled
cheerfully. “So anyway, I’m Itsuki Akazawa. I’m best friends with that
knucklehead over there. If Amane ever does anything stupid or weird, you
can come talk to me any time.”
“Is that any way to talk about your best friend?” Amane said.
“...Well, Fujimiya doesn’t seem to have any interest in me,” Mahiru
said. “He may not have any basic life skills, but he’s an otherwise ordinary
guy, so I’m not expecting any trouble.”
“Thanks, I guess...but you could have left out the part about me being
incompetent.” Amane could have gone without that specific remark, but he
was happy to hear that Mahiru did indeed see him as a person she could
trust.
Itsuki drew close and whispered in Amane’s ear, “You’ve gotten awfully
close to Shiina for somebody who says he’s not interested.”
Amane would be lying if he said he wasn’t interested at all, but he really
wasn’t actively trying to steer their relationship in that direction. He was
certain that Mahiru just wanted a close friend, not a romantic partner. The
two of them were happy spending their time together as they had been.
Glancing at Mahiru, Amane saw that she’d gotten all flustered again.
Chitose had begun another round of interrogation, having decided her
conversation with Amane was over.
However, Mahiru didn’t seem to hate the attention, and Amane hoped
that maybe when she got more comfortable, she might relax a little.
As bewildered as she was, Mahiru responded to the barrage of questions
with a small smile. It came as no small relief for Amane that the two girls
were getting acquainted without any issue.


“I’m really sorry.”
After night had fallen, and Itsuki and Chitose had gone home, Amane
apologized to Mahiru, who looked more than a little worn-out.
It was obvious that Mahiru had been left exhausted and confused after
dealing with two strangers who’d just discovered their secret. This
conversation felt like an exact repeat of the one they’d had after Shihoko’s
surprise visit.
“No, my own carelessness was what caused it, after all,” Mahiru refuted.
“They sure did make a fuss.”
“They’re...lively people.”
“You can be honest; they’re both loudmouths.”
“They were a little assertive, but they’re interesting.”
“‘A little’ is being very generous... Well, as long as you didn’t mind, I
guess it’s all good.”
Amane was convinced that his friends’ behavior had crossed the line for
Mahiru, but the mild-mannered girl was taking it all in stride. He was glad
that she hadn’t found them too troublesome, but he wasn’t sure whether it
was a good thing that she and Chitose were apparently becoming friends.
_Chitose is a totally different type of girl from Mahiru. Very...energetic?
Which is nice, I suppose._ He trusted Chitose not to do anything malicious,
but he would need to keep an eye on her to be certain she gave Mahiru
enough space.
“I don’t have any people like that in my life, so it was kind of fun.”
“Right, I imagine you don’t really have anyone like Chitose in your
circle... If she gets too persistent, you can just slap her, okay?”
“I w-would never resort to violence, so I’ll do my best to keep her in
check with my words.”
Chitose had an excess of energy and often let her enthusiasm get the
better of her. Amane was sure that eventually his advice would be
warranted. As he fixed in his mind an oath to caution Chitose directly the
next time he saw her, Amane turned toward the window and watched the
snow fluttering down.
_If it weren’t for this weather, we never would’ve been discovered_ , he
thought. Snowflakes were supposed to carry good tidings for lovers
everywhere, however, so Amane didn’t think it right to curse them for his
troubles.


Mahiru also seemed to enjoy watching the snow because, once she
realized what Amane was looking at, she stared out the window in the exact
same way.
It was winter, so the sun had set early. The sky was dark, and the snow
was pale, and he could just barely see the flakes falling in the light coming
from the surrounding apartment buildings.
“A white Christmas, huh?” Mahiru said.
“Yeah, I guess so,” Amane answered. “Though, that sappy stuff doesn’t
have much to do with us.”
“It’s still very pretty. Isn’t that enough?”
Spending a romantic white Christmas together didn’t mean anything to
them, since they weren’t a couple, but...Mahiru seemed to be enjoying the
sight anyway, so the snow couldn’t be all bad.
The dancing snowflakes lightly dusted the surroundings, leaving the
dark world coated in a powdery whiteness. At the rate it was falling, the
chance of the snow really piling up didn’t seem very high.
“If it’s too heavy, though, public transit will shut down, so I hope it’s
only a light snow,” Mahiru commented.
“That’s very pragmatic of you,” Amane remarked.
“People can’t survive on romance alone,” Mahiru answered.
“You’re exactly right.”
Albeit in an unusual way, the snow had brought them closer together,
after all.
They both smiled slightly, and Mahiru stood up.
“All right then, I’ll bring dinner over.”
“Huh, bring it over?”
“I made beef stew at my place earlier. I thought for sure that if I roasted
a whole turkey, the two of us wouldn’t be able to finish it...”
“It would never have even occurred to me to roast a turkey.”
“You’re just bad at cooking, Amane. For lunch tomorrow, I was thinking
we could make omelet rices with beef stew on top.”
“That sounds so delicious...” Amane’s mind had already leaped straight
past tonight’s dinner and had started looking forward to tomorrow’s lunch.
“I like my eggs cooked hard.”
“What a coincidence; I’ve always preferred them that way, too. Okay,
I’m bringing the stew pot over.”


Mahiru sauntered out of Amane’s apartment and headed back to her own
place for a moment. Vacantly, Amane watched her as she left, reflecting on
the turbulent day.
He really hadn’t expected to be discovered. His friends might have
suspected that something was up, and Amane had anticipated them growing
curious, but he never would’ve expected that Mahiru would simply step
right onto center stage.
Part of him wished that their relationship could’ve stayed their secret for
just a little while longer.
_What am I thinking?_ Amane wondered. It was better this way. He no
longer had to hide everything from Itsuki and Chitose, which made his life
much easier. So then why did he feel a bit wistful? Where was this strange
feeling coming from? Though everything had turned out okay, some part of
Amane was still agitated, and he needed to relax.
“Did something happen?” Mahiru had returned, holding the stew pot,
and she tilted her head questioningly as she stared at Amane with a
confused look.
“...It’s nothing.” Amane straightened out his expression, but Mahiru still
seemed puzzled for a good while by the expression she had spotted on his
face.

“...Phew, that was good.”
Unsurprisingly, Mahiru’s cooking had been delicious. With it being
Christmas, she had made even more elaborate dishes than usual. She had
turned the rest of her carefully simmered beef stew into a pot pie, which she
and Amane had shared.
Splitting the pie open and eating the crispy, textured crust together with
the rich sauce of the beef stew could only be described as a moment of
sublime bliss.
Mahiru had apparently prepared the pie dough especially for this. Truly
impressed by her culinary prowess, Amane loosed a contented sigh while
polishing off his second pastry of the day, another product of Mahiru’s
skilled hands.
While making the dough for the pot pie, Mahiru had apparently taken
the opportunity to prepare another type of sweet dough at the same time.


She’d used it to make handmade mille-feuille for dessert. This girl was
already working at a professional level.
“I’m glad you like it... You sure ate plenty,” Mahiru observed.
“Mm. Because it was delicious,” Amane replied.
“Thank you for saying so.”
Amane had grown accustomed to seeing the faint, relieved smile that
emerged on Mahiru’s face whenever he complimented her food. He had
made it his daily mission to see that expression, as it was so much softer
than her usual reserved countenance. Though an embarrassing thought,
Amane liked to think of it as a special kind of smile reserved just for him.
“...So tomorrow we’re having omelets over rice, huh...? I’m really
looking forward to it.”
“You really do like eggs, don’t you? You tore into those rolled dashi
omelets with incredible enthusiasm.”
“They were delicious; I couldn’t help it.”
Even though eggs were one of his favorite foods, Amane couldn’t stand
them if they were badly cooked. The fact that he’d wolfed them down was
just more proof of Mahiru’s excellent preparation.
Though Amane recognized that it was awfully selfish to be keeping her
cooking all to himself, he was not inclined to share with anybody else. The
plan was to keep enjoying it for as long as possible.
“...Amane, you look super happy when you’re eating, you know?”
Mahiru said.
“Of course, because your cooking is so good,” he replied.
“I’m flattered, but...really, it’s nothing that special.”
“No, it definitely is... You need to get a better sense of your own
worth...”
This was the homemade food of an angel; there were more than a few
boys who’d do anything to have some.
“But to me, this is just the stuff I make every day.”
“I’m a lucky guy.”
“...Why’s that?”
“Because the stuff you make every day is so delicious.”
Amane was a boy ruled by his stomach, and being able to enjoy
delicious, freshly made meals so regularly was, for him, the ultimate
happiness.


“How did you get so good at cooking anyway?” Amane asked.
“Someone important to me once said ‘Make sure you grab anyone who
makes you happy by the stomach,’ and I took those words to heart,” Mahiru
answered.
“Sorry you ended up grabbing me instead.”
“I’m thinking of it as a rehearsal.” Mahiru’s candor caught Amane by
surprise. A small smile spread across her lips.
“...But seriously, whoever taught you must have been amazing.”
“That’s right; they were an incredible cook. I’m still no match for them.
Their cooking tasted like pure happiness.” Mahiru took on a faraway look
with a gentle smile. The expression felt reassuring to Amane.
From the way Mahiru described it, the person in question had obviously
loved her very much, and Amane could tell that Mahiru had idolized them
as well. She must have been really lucky to have someone like that in her
life.
“I bet it was really good,” Amane said, nodding. “But you know...to
me, your cooking is what tastes like happiness.”
Leaving his mother aside for the moment, Amane’s father was a decent
cook, but Mahiru’s dishes suited Amane’s tastes better. Mahiru’s cooking
was comforting yet exciting, with a relaxing flavor that he didn’t think he
could get tired of, even if he had it three times a day for the rest of his life.
No matter how much he ate, he just wanted more and more.
Though, of course, he could never say that. It’d put too much of a
burden on Mahiru.
Suddenly, the girl stiffened. She looked like she’d been attacked in an
unguarded moment. She stared at Amane with an innocent and somewhat
vacant expression.
“...Mahiru?” Amane asked.
“Ah...it’s nothing.” Snapping back to her senses, Mahiru quickly shook
her head, then stared down at the floor. Hugging her favorite cushion tight,
she let out a soft sigh. Something about her had completely changed in the
last few seconds. It was strangely endearing.
“What’s up?” Amane asked.
“...It’s just—to think that someone like me could make something taste
like happiness...”
“I don’t know why you’re putting yourself down, but your food is so


good that I want to eat it every day.”
“Th-thank you.” Mahiru looked up at Amane with a bit of a bashful look
and a small grin. The sight of it filled Amane with the urge to hide his face.
This kind of expression was rare for Mahiru, but it inevitably set
Amane’s heart rattling in his chest, even though he’d constantly told
himself that he wasn’t interested in her like that. Seeing Mahiru’s smiling
visage stripped of its usual stony mask made him suddenly feel hot, and
Amane worried that she would notice and get embarrassed herself.
“Say, um, Mahiru?”
“Yes?”
“Tomorrow we’ll be meeting up around lunchtime, right?”
Unable to stand the atmosphere any longer, Amane forced a change of
subject. Mahiru didn’t seem to take much notice, however, and she idly
considered what Amane had asked.
“Yes, that’s the plan, isn’t it? We’ll make lunch, then play games like we
promised... That was it, right?”
“Yeah.”
“Unless...you don’t want to?”
“No, I was just confirming. Really, even though we spent Christmas Eve
together, are you sure it’s okay to spend your next day with me, too?”
“If I hated the idea, I wouldn’t have suggested it... I’m looking forward
to it.” Another small smile appeared on the gentle curve of Mahiru’s lips.
“Y-yeah,” Amane muttered. It was all he could do to turn away and hide
his growing embarrassment.


When Mahiru arrived at Amane’s apartment the following day, she seemed
a little restless. It would’ve been perfectly understandable to be nervous
about visiting the home of a member of the opposite sex on a holiday, but
that didn’t seem to be it.
_Mahiru wants to play games. She’s probably just excited._
Apparently, this would be her first time ever playing a video game. In
some ways, she was like a sheltered highborn young lady who knew little of
the world at large.
“Before we play, I’ll make lunch, okay?” Mahiru confirmed.
“Mm. I’ll have mine well-done, please,” Amane answered casually.
“I know; I remember.”
Even dealing with such a demanding customer didn’t seem to dampen
the girl’s mood. With a flutter of her apron, she headed for the kitchen and
began preparations for lunch. From the way she was behaving, Mahiru
seemed to be quite pleased.
Amane felt a little awkward and embarrassed about how much he had
been looking forward to this.
_It’s just because I’m looking forward to enjoying the games, that’s all_ , he
told himself. It certainly was not that he had been excited about spending
time alone with the next-door angel. As he watched Mahiru’s ponytail
swaying back and forth, Amane smiled wryly to himself.

“...How are you supposed to hold it?”
After lunch, the two of them settled on the sofa in front of the TV. Both


were now looking straight at the screen.
When Amane had asked her what game she wanted to play, it became
apparent that Mahiru didn’t even know where to start, so he’d booted up a
well-known 2D game and handed her a controller. Unfortunately, Mahiru
immediately got flustered as it became apparent that she had no idea what
to do with it.
“Uh, okay, so you move around with this joystick, and you jump with
this button...”
Mahiru, usually so calm and collected, was looking back and forth
between the controller and the TV as she manipulated her character on-
screen. It was obvious that this was her first time. She charged straight at
the enemies without dodging, dying over and over again. Amane began to
wonder if perhaps there were things even an angel couldn’t do, though she
did seem to be gradually improving, if ever so slowly.
“...I can’t win,” Mahiru professed.
“Never mind clearing the stage—you haven’t even defeated the first
enemy,” Amane observed.
“Oh, shut up.”
“Well, it’s just a matter of practice; you gotta keep trying. Get that
muscle memory.”
Amane warned Mahiru that it would be a challenge, but she didn’t seem
ready to give up. It was charming to watch the girl tackle the game with
such a serious expression. Amane couldn’t help but smile.
Unfortunately, Mahiru was just too much of a beginner and kept on
losing. Eventually, it was obvious that she was growing frustrated. As she
shot a glance at Amane, he could have sworn he heard a gamelike sound
effect accompany her sullen face.
“Ah, here, you need to do it like this...” Mahiru was sure to lose interest
if she continued to metaphorically bash her head against a wall, so Amane
put his hand on the controller she was holding and tried to physically show
her what to do.
Amane had cleared this game on countless occasions, so he was able to
help Mahiru get through tough spots. Surprisingly, Mahiru was actually
worse than the average player. Most people wouldn’t have gotten stuck
nearly as many times as she did, but Amane kept that thought private.
“Look, this enemy moves at a consistent speed in an irregular pattern,


but if you watch here, he moves toward your character and speeds up as he
approaches. Just watch your timing and jump.”
Amane put his hand over Mahiru’s smaller one and gripped the
controller to manipulate the character on the TV, showing her how as he
explained. On the screen, the game character moved as Amane had said it
would, avoiding the oncoming enemy.
It wasn’t much of a move, but it was apparently enough to impress
Mahiru, who let out a small gasp of astonishment. Her eyes, rimmed with
long lashes, snapped wide open, and her expression brightened.
The two were sitting closer together than they ever had before, and
Amane noticed for the first time that Mahiru’s lower lashes were fairly
long, too. Smiling, he watched Mahiru happily play.
As Amane admired her beautiful profile, Mahiru turned toward him,
possibly because she’d felt his eyes on her. He’d needed to get close in
order to be able to reach the controller, so the two had ended up far nearer
to each other than either had expected. Their arms and hands were even
touching, and Amane could feel Mahiru’s breath lightly grazing his skin.
Amane found himself surrounded by warmth and a faint, sweet fragrance.
“S-sorry...” Amane suddenly realized that his hands were almost
completely covering Mahiru’s, and he pulled away in a panic, while
Mahiru’s eyes darted around the room as if she had only just realized they
were touching at all.
Blinking dramatically, Mahiru replied, “No...it’s fine. I’m the one who
should apologize.”
The girl’s cheeks had flushed scarlet, and Amane was filled with regret
over what he’d done.
Mahiru wasn’t a fan of physical contact. No matter how used to each
other they had gotten, having someone touch her hands like that had
probably been too much for her. Thankfully, while she looked fairly
embarrassed, she didn’t appear upset or angry.
“Really, I’m sorry,” Amane said again.
“Um, I’m not that bothered by it...,” Mahiru said.
“Don’t you hate physical contact?”
“...I was surprised but not upset. It’s not like you’re a stranger.”
It seemed that today, the magnanimous angel had seen fit to forgive
Amane’s transgression. Relieved at how easily Mahiru let it go, Amane


restarted the game.
Fixing his eyes on the TV screen, Amane got ready to help Mahiru make
some real progress in the game this time. Then he saw that her character
had fallen off the stage—a rather predictable outcome. Amane was
seriously beginning to wonder if he could do anything to help her get better.
In the end, Mahiru somehow managed to clear one level, whining all the
while. The two of them agreed that was probably a good stopping place for
the time being.
If Amane kept making a total beginner face death, it would have a
considerable effect on her motivation. His plan for now was to get her to try
another game and loosen up.
“Mahiru, you’re tilting.”
To that end, next Amane had suggested a racing game, since that had
some grounding in the real world, but Mahiru was leaning with her entire
body.
There was no gyroscopic control element to the game, so there was
absolutely no need to physically move around. Amane wasn’t sure whether
Mahiru even noticed what she was doing, but she swayed left and right with
every turn she made in the game.
In contrast to the earlier game, this one was all about driving a car, and
Amane had thought it’d be easier, since pretty much everyone understood
the concept of driving to some degree. Playing through the tutorial also
might’ve helped, because even though Mahiru’s driving was a bit clumsy,
she was able to handle the actual gameplay.
She was trying her absolute hardest to perform well. Her body swayed
this way and that while she maintained a very serious expression.
_This is ridiculously cute_ , Amane thought.
Mahiru was strangely adorable, rocking back and forth like a pendulum.
Her intense focus and effort only made her look even cuter.
With every turn, Mahiru’s body automatically leaned way to the side.
Eventually, she tumbled right onto Amane’s lap, and he was forced to choke
down a laugh.
“...You really don’t need to tilt your whole body, you know?” he said.
“I-it wasn’t on purpose,” Mahiru replied sheepishly.
“Yeah, I know. But still, you were leaning pretty far.”
Mahiru sat back up, somehow keeping her trembling, pouty lips in


check.



The girl had felt soft and light when she’d accidentally flopped on him.
That much was to be expected as Mahiru had a small build, but she was so
slim that sometimes Amane worried she might snap in half.
Roused out of Amane’s lap, Mahiru’s cheeks were flushing, and her
body was trembling, likely from embarrassment. It was times like these that
the girl really resembled a small animal.
Finally, Amane couldn’t stand it anymore, and he burst into a fit of
laughter.
“A-are you making fun of me?” Mahiru demanded.
“No, no. I was just thinking how charming you are.”
“So you _are_ making fun of me!”
“You think I’d mock someone while they’re trying their best?”
“No, but...”
“See? You were just very cute; that’s all.”
“...When you say cute, I’m sure you mean childish.”
There was a bit of a peevish overtone to Mahiru’s words, and Amane
was worried she might get depressed if he teased too much; thus he decided
to keep any further thoughts to himself. He flashed Mahiru a half smile in
response to her expression of disapproval, and she quickly turned away.
Any trace of the angel’s gloomy mood vanished instantly when she
returned to the game. Her intense concentration overrode everything else on
her face. It was becoming clear that she was getting used to the game, as
she was managing to keep up with the other cars, if a little awkwardly.
Amane had been right to assume a more familiar concept like steering a car
was better for Mahiru. She did still veer off course into the dirt or slam into
a wall a few times, though.
Amane had been worried she might end up running the whole course
backward, since she’d never played a game before, but he was relieved to
see that she was making better progress than he’d expected.
Trying to play the racing game together with Mahiru proved to be a little
difficult, as she kept distracting Amane without realizing it. As she tilted
her whole body back and forth with the game, she occasionally leaned right
into him. Each time she did so, a lovely scent would waft over him, making
it difficult to keep his composure.
Even with the unusual handicap, Amane still managed to maintain a
huge lead. They were competing against the weakest computer opponents,


after all.
“...How are you so fast?” Mahiru inquired.
“Practice and experience,” Amane replied.
After playing the game so many times, Amane knew the course by heart
and understood how to best navigate the turns. Even with Mahiru’s outside
interference, he was able to seize every advantage and hold the lead without
much trouble.
Glancing back at Mahiru, who appeared utterly dumbstruck, Amane
quietly switched the game to solo mode and dropped out of the competition.
Mahiru didn’t have enough experience, so Amane thought it’d be better to
play together after he let her practice by herself for a while. It was better
that she got comfortable playing against computer-controlled characters
rather than feel disappointed over losing to Amane.
Thankfully, it was clear that Mahiru had no shortage of determination,
and she stared enthusiastically at the screen even after going to solo play.
With an attitude like that, Amane was sure she would quickly learn to hold
her own against a computer opponent.
It was obvious what a hard worker she was, even with something like a
video game. Such perseverance was rather charming, but whenever Amane
let a smile slip onto his face, Mahiru would quickly take notice and slap his
knees in protest.
If he laughed too much, amused by her protests, Mahiru would frown
and grumble, “Amane, you idiot.”

“I won.”
After two hours of dogged perseverance, Mahiru crossed the finish line
as the words FIRST PLACE flashed across the screen. She turned to look at
Amane, obviously proud of herself.
After a hard-won battle with the racing game, Mahiru had achieved the
glory of finishing first.
Though she’d ended up in last place on so many earlier tries, Mahiru
had refused to quit and kept going, improving her ranking bit by bit until at
last, she won. Such investment had probably made the victory quite
emotional.
Mahiru’s expression seemed to proclaim “I did it!” and Amane dutifully


clapped in admiration.
“That’s great. I could tell you really tried hard,” he praised.
“Yep!” Perhaps because Mahiru was enjoying the praise, her usual
demeanor had softened, and she appeared a little bashful. She didn’t break
into a huge, obvious grin but instead wore a fleeting, shy curl of the lips that
looked ever-so-slightly pleased. It seemed so sweet that it was hard to
believe it belonged to the same cool, reserved person.
Recently, Mahiru had been acting more like a regular teenage girl and
less like a perfect young lady. Today most of all, she was really acting like a
kid. Her cherubic smile had something innocent about it, and looking at her,
Amane felt his sense of reason begin to give way as the roaring desire to
hold her close rose within him. The urge to pet Mahiru like a cat seized
control of his arm, and before he knew it, Amane found himself reaching
out toward her.
“Is something the matter?” Mahiru asked.
Quickly, Amane regained control of his wayward limb. “Ah, n-no, it’s
nothing. You really got good at this, h-huh?”
“I’m getting better?”
“For sure. You’re way better than when you first started.”
“Thank you. It was a lot of fun, so I guess I got pretty engrossed.”
Mahiru chuckled to herself.
Amane avoided making eye contact by crossing the room and retrieving
a small box from a basket on the shelf. “Let’s say this is your prize for first
place,” he said.
“Ah, um, that’s really not—”
“If you don’t like the idea of a prize, then think of this as something left
behind by a stout old man with a white beard and a red suit.”
It was a Christmas present that Amane had carelessly forgotten to give
Mahiru the day before.
Since Mahiru’s birthday and Christmas weren’t that far apart, Amane
had expected some difficulty picking out this second gift. Thankfully, he’d
also gotten a little more familiar with the practice, so it surprisingly wound
up not being as tough to choose a Christmas present as it had been finding
one for Mahiru’s birthday.
Mahiru blinked rapidly, as if the reference to a Christmas present had
just reminded her that today was in fact Christmas, and she nervously


accepted the box. At Amane’s urging, she carefully undid the wrapping.
_Well, it’s nothing special, though_ , Amane thought.
She opened the box and slowly took out the gift. It was a leather key
holder.
Expecting Mahiru to feel uncomfortable if Amane got her something too
expensive, Amane had avoided getting a fancy brand-name item. He’d
selected this one purely because the design seemed like it would suit
Mahiru.
It was simple, with flowers and ivy carved into the leather, making it
perfect for everyday use. Amane wasn’t too well versed in flowers, so he
didn’t know exactly which ones were featured in the design, but he thought
their dainty forms suited Mahiru well, and that’s why he’d chosen it.
“Well, I gave you my spare key and all. If you don’t want to use it, that’s
okay, too,” Amane said.
“No, I definitely will, thank you. You’ve got a better sense of style than I
expected, Amane,” Mahiru replied.
“What do you mean, better than expected?”
“I mean, normally you just wear sweatpants or jeans... It’s not like
you’re into fashion or anything.”
“I just don’t own anything besides functional clothes.”
Getting dressed up in nicer outfits was a tedium that Amane avoided
whenever possible. He’d never had the occasion to show Mahiru what he
looked like in better clothing, so she’d only ever seen him in his school
uniform and casual house clothes. It was no wonder she assumed he had no
fashion sense. Such a guess had been right on the money, and Amane didn’t
seem likely to dispel that slovenly impression anytime soon.
“...If you made an effort, you’d probably look pretty good, you know?
You kept up your appearance in middle school, didn’t you?” Mahiru asked.
“That was because my mom forced me to... Wait, how do you know
that?”
“Shihoko sent me this picture and said, ‘Here’s what he could look like
if he tried’...”
“Unbelievable.”
Amane was shocked to see the photo of the time his mother had dressed
him up and brought him to work. Silently, Amane cursed his mother’s
indiscretion.


“...That style didn’t suit me.”
“I suppose you’re right, Amane. You know, you never make eye contact,
and your face is always hidden behind your hair, but I think you have rather
distinguished features...”
Mahiru’s small hand stretched out toward Amane’s face, and her white
palm brushed against his forehead as she pushed his long bangs upward.
She was looking at him with a curious expression. He didn’t think his face
was anything to marvel over; it was perfectly ordinary—not quite ugly and
not quite handsome. Amane began to wonder why Mahiru was staring so
intently at him.
“...What is it?” he asked.
“Nothing. Your eyes look livelier than they used to, that’s all,” Mahiru
replied.
Without looking away, Mahiru reminded Amane that several months
earlier, his face had been vacant like a zombie’s.
While Mahiru continued to stare, Amane was beginning to feel
uncomfortable that a girl, not to mention an incredible beauty, was staring
at him so intently. He wondered what she found so fascinating about his
boring looks.
Eventually, he couldn’t stand it anymore. Amane slowly reached out and
brushed a lock of hair away from Mahiru’s own lovely face. He was
hesitant to touch her, but she had reached out and touched his hair so
casually that he thought she’d probably forgive him for doing the same. It
would only be the faintest moment of contact; surely that much would be all
right.
_But wow, she really is beautiful..._
Mahiru was much prettier than the glamorous models in the magazines
that had previously been scattered around Amane’s room—and much more
appealing. Something about her felt amazing every time he looked upon
her.
Photographs, Amane knew, couldn’t be trusted anyway. Even if they
could capture a moment of beauty, preserving it in time, photographs could
be made to deceive. Mahiru, however, was standing there before him in the
flesh. Her beauty was real—unadulterated. Amane didn’t think he could
ever get tired of beholding such a creature.
As Amane continued studying her features, Mahiru’s eyes started to


shift, and she pulled away from him, dropping her controller. Amane
wondered what was bothering her as she hugged a nearby couch cushion
tight against her chest.
“Um. So...right. I have a Christmas present for you, too.”
“Um, oh, thanks.”
Amane was about to ask what on earth it might be, when Mahiru cut him
off by pulling out a nicely decorated gift bag from her purse. Hastily, she
pushed it into his hands.
“All right, I’m going to prepare dinner.”
“Huh? Y-you are...?”
With those words, Mahiru quickly stood and moved to the kitchen.
Amane was left with nothing but bewilderment at the overly rapid
development.

After Amane finished washing the dishes from dinner, he returned to the
living room to find that Mahiru was restless. She was sitting beside him, in
the way they had recently grown accustomed to, but this time, Mahiru was
having trouble maintaining her composure. She’d been averting her gaze all
through dinner, too.
This was a kind of self-consciousness that Mahiru had seemed
previously incapable of, prompting Amane to wonder if something had
happened. Perhaps it had something to do with her giving him the gift?
When Amane had given Mahiru the teddy bear, he, too, had felt like
running away, and it’d been difficult for him to calm down. Maybe Mahiru
was experiencing a similar sort of anxiety.
“By the way, can I open this?” Amane asked.
“P-please do.”
Amane picked up the gift from where he’d left it sitting atop the coffee
table, and Mahiru nodded somewhat hesitantly. Concluding that she was
indeed nervous about giving him a present, Amane untied the ribbon
fastening the bag.
Right away, he could tell from the feel and weight that it was something
made out of cloth. When Amane pulled it out and saw it to be a length of
black-and-white houndstooth, he wasn’t sure what it was. After spreading
out the whole object, however, he immediately understood.


“A scarf?”
It appeared to be quite soft and luxurious. Surely, this would keep him
warm if he wound it around his neck.
“...Well, you’re indifferent to fashion, and you always seem cold on the
way to school, so...”
“I can really use it; and wow, it feels so nice.”
“Quality is important when you’re choosing something that you’ll be
using every day,” Mahiru explained.
As Mahiru was someone who only wore high-quality clothes, Amane
was sure she knew what she was talking about. Mahiru seemed like the type
who considered it a waste of time to buy cheap things, preferring to use
well-made products that would last for a long time, instead. If this scarf met
her standards, it had to be very nice indeed.
Amane could tell just by touching it that the scarf had a luxurious
texture and was soft enough not to bother even sensitive skin.
Impressed with Mahiru’s high standards, Amane waved the gift at her
while she watched him with a stiff expression.
“Can I try it on?” Amane asked.
“I gave it to you, so you can do whatever you like,” Mahiru answered
curtly.
“Roger.”
Amane smiled at her blunt response and wrapped the scarf around
himself. He could feel the quality of the fabric even more on his neck,
where the skin was more sensitive. It kept all the warmth in without letting
too much air pass through. The feel of the fabric was soothing and snug. As
Amane was still inside, it was hard to tell just how effective the scarf would
be, but he trusted it would undoubtedly keep him comfortable throughout
the winter months.
“Wow, it’s super warm.”
“That’s great.”
Amane put on a gentle smile, and Mahiru answered with a relieved
smile of her own. Recently, Mahiru had begun to show Amane her many
kinds of smiles more frequently, and he found himself staring again at her
enchanting features.
_...When she looks like that, she really does seem like an angel..._
Sure, everyone at school said Mahiru looked heavenly, but Amane


thought it was far more attractive when she smiled like this and showed her
true self.
“Wh-what is it?” Mahiru had noticed that Amane was staring straight at
her. Her eyes shifted left and right before fixing themselves back on the one
gazing at her.
“Nothing; I was just thinking that you seem much more relaxed
compared to when I first met you.”
“...Is that so?”
Mahiru looked surprised, and Amane laughed a little.
“Yeah. Before, you were all stuck-up and not cute at all.”
“That was terrible of me, not being cute,” Mahiru said sarcastically.
“Come on—don’t sulk... Now you’re way more... How should I put it?
I think you just look better. I was thinking that the way you smile now is
way cuter. It’s really kind of a shame you weren’t smiling like that sooner.”
Mahiru had always been beautiful, but some quality of that changed in
how she carried herself.
The angelic smile that she showed at school had the beauty of something
to be appreciated from a distance. It was a fragile thing that was not be
touched.
The cold look that she’d first given Amane held the appeal of something
wreathed in thorns to keep humans from getting too close.
Now her soft and innocent smile had a welcoming warmth that made
Amane want to caress and cherish her.
Amane thought about how Mahiru had changed. She’d slowly gotten
used to being around him, and she’d slowly opened up her heart. As he
thought back on the time they’d spent together, Amane felt a ticklish
sensation gradually rising through his chest and up into his cheeks.
“I’m happy that you can smile so naturally now, and that you’ve gotten
used to hanging around with me, and... What are you doing?”
Amane’s sentence was physically cut off as Mahiru lifted the scarf up
from around his neck to cover his face with the fabric. She didn’t wrap it
tight, but it grew a bit stuffy and hot as the material trapped Amane’s
breath.
“...Please just be quiet for a bit,” Mahiru commanded.
“What for?”
“...Nothing.”


Amane didn’t understand this sudden outburst of eccentric behavior. He
grabbed the wrist of her hand that was holding up the scarf and pushed it
back down. With his vision restored, he could see Mahiru’s flaxen hair and
the tinge of color spread across her cheeks, and he noticed that she was
trembling slightly. As she looked at him, she grew even more flushed.
He wondered why she was making such an odd face, and then it
suddenly hit him that there could be only one answer.
“...Don’t tell me...you’re embarrassed?”
“Shut up.”
Mahiru turned away sharply, which only served to confirm what Amane
had said. Without meaning to, Amane smiled as he mused that the angel
sure could be prickly about things like this.
Mahiru groaned and quietly muttered, “I’m going outside for some air.”
Then she quickly made for the veranda.
Through the window, Amane could see it snowing just like it had the
day before, but Mahiru didn’t seem to care and stepped out onto the balcony
anyway.
Chilly air rushed into the apartment, and Amane shivered. Though
Mahiru immediately shut the door, a touch of cold still hung about the
living room. Amane let out a quiet sigh.
_It’s fine for her to run away to hide her embarrassment, but she could at
least do it in a slightly warmer outfit._
Mahiru had obviously picked her clothes assuming she would be
spending the day inside—or at least wearing a heavy jacket if she went out.
She’d clearly prioritized looks over warmth, and her slender body was sure
to chill quickly in the cold.
Amane cursed under his breath and picked up the blanket that was lying
over the back of the sofa.
_It’s super dangerous to stand outside in the snow wearing such thin
clothing._
After pulling on his coat, Amane followed Mahiru out onto the veranda
and wrapped the blanket around her shoulders.
“Getting some fresh air is fine, but you’ll catch a cold like that,” chided
Amane.
Mahiru quickly turned to face him. “...Isn’t that my line?” Clearly,
she’d calmed down, as she’d answered with her usual demeanor and


expression, though there was a bit of a sulking tone to her voice. Maybe she
was feeling down because Amane had said something that called back to
the conversation from when they’d first met.
“Hmph. That only happened because I didn’t get in a bath and warm up
like I should have. Simple negligence,” Amane reminded.
“Next time you get soaked like a drowned rat, make sure you warm
yourself up right. If I’m there, I’ll be sure to toss you in the bath myself,”
Mahiru shot back.
“What’re you, my mom?”
There were definitely times when Mahiru said some rather motherly
things.
With a smile, Amane recalled his first encounter with the angel. It’d
been around the time autumn usually started getting cold, about halfway
through October. He hadn’t expected to come down with a fever just from
getting a little wet, but the weather had gotten chillier far faster than it
usually did back in his hometown. Thinking back on it, Amane admitted to
himself that perhaps he really had been careless.
The most surprising part of the whole situation, however, had definitely
been Mahiru nursing him back to health.
“...Y’know, it’s already been two months since we started talking...,”
Amane said wistfully.
“You’re right. And to think, your room was so dirty! It was terrible...
Now it only haunts my memories,” Mahiru quipped.
“Oh, hush. I’m keeping it clean now, right?”
“And who do you owe for that?”
“Why, Lady Mahiru, of course. It makes me want to bow down in
humble gratitude.”
“You don’t need to do that, geez.”
Back on that rainy day, Amane would never have believed that he and
Mahiru would get to a point where they could banter like this. It all seemed
so long ago now, but really, it had only been a short while back. A lot had
changed in those two months. Time had really flown by.
A silence fell over the two, and suddenly, everything was quiet.
The snow, which had been starting and stopping in fits since yesterday,
was now drifting softly down from the sky, painting the surrounding
apartment buildings in a pale hue.


Amane and Mahiru’s building was in residential area, plus it was
Christmas, so the area was hushed. From some apartment nearby, the pair
could very faintly hear the sounds of a Christmas song, though not well
enough to decipher any lyrics.
Mahiru exhaled a little white puff, and Amane’s ears caught that sound
better than any other.
“...It’s kind of a strange feeling.” Mahiru was the one to break the
silence. “At first, I was wondering ‘What’s up with this guy?’”
“Well, I guess that’s not surprising. Anyone would be suspicious if
someone suddenly forced an umbrella on them... What do you think now?”
“Hmm, let’s see. I’d have to say...you’re a whole lot of work.” Mahiru
turned away after her ambiguous answer.
“You’re not wrong.” Amane smiled while leaning against the veranda
railing. “...You know, I never thought that we would get close enough to be
eating meals together like this, either. To be honest, I always thought of you
as someone to be admired from a distance. I never considered ever getting
involved with you.”
“That was certainly honest...though I knew that already. That’s
precisely why I trust you,” Mahiru said, and her body shook with laughter.
Amane knew that Mahiru only accepted him in her life because he
wasn’t attracted to her; and apparently, she felt the same way.
“Still, I’m glad that I got to know you like this. My life has really
improved a ton, I’m happy because I get to eat delicious food every day,
and I feel at ease when I’m hanging out with you,” Amane declared.
“...You really think so?”
“I do. I’m incredibly grateful for these past two months. Thank you.”
Amane couldn’t have been more sincere if he tried. It was thanks to Mahiru
that his standard of living had gone up and that he got to enjoy a delicious
meal every day. Surprisingly, Amane had also discovered that he could
enjoy talking to a girl without any sort of awkward expectations. It’d even
become something he looked forward to. Even better, Mahiru would
occasionally flash him adorable reactions when Amane teased her, and he
never got tired of those.
_Recently, she’s started to laugh more, too._
As Amane had realized before, Mahiru had indeed started displaying a
richer array of emotions, a change that only made her more endearing.


Amane would never actually act on his feelings, of course, but...just
looking at her made him feel at peace.
Mahiru’s eyes were wide, and Amane couldn’t tell whether the slight
redness in her cheeks was because of the cold or because she was
embarrassed.
“No, thank _you_ very much,” she said.
“But I didn’t do anything.” From Amane’s perspective, Mahiru was the
one who’d done everything for him. He was sure he hadn’t given the girl
anything in return, but she slowly shook her head in disagreement.
“...I’m grateful for things that you aren’t aware of, Amane,” Mahiru
explained.
“Hmm... Each of us telling the other what we’re thankful for has sort of
an end-of-the-year vibe. I guess that’s not all that weird, since the year is
about to end.”
Curiously, both Amane and Mahiru had thanked the other for certain
things, despite the new year still being six days away.
Mahiru’s eyes sparkled at the mention of the end of the year, and she let
a little laugh slip out. “Ha-ha, that’s right. It’s still a little early, but...Happy
New Year, Amane. Let’s make it a good one.”
“...Yeah, Happy New Year.” Amane nodded and smiled at Mahiru’s
heaven-sent proposal.
Then Mahiru suddenly said, “I’m freezing; let’s go on inside, shall we?”
She turned around and opened the glass door that led back to Amane’s
living room.
Amane caught a glimpse of her ears, which had turned bright red in the
frosty air, and he agreed that it was best to retreat inside so as not to catch
cold.
_...One way or another, I guess I’ve also taken a liking to this lifestyle.
That’s probably why my chest feels so warm._ As he followed Mahiru back
into the apartment, Amane watched the gentle swaying of her soft, flaxen
hair and smiled secretly to himself.
He hoped that in the days to come, he would continue to see more of the
angel who lived next door.


Nice to meet you. My name is Saeki.

I trust you enjoyed _The Angel Next Door_?
I set out to write this book as a heartwarming, slow-but-steady, fluffy
little romantic comedy, and I’m pretty sure I managed to do just that.
Both characters started out rather distant and cold, but they gradually
came to trust each other and found themselves charmed by the other before
they knew what was happening. It was quite enjoyable to write those
changes in their emotions and their relationship.
I think it’s good to have those kinds of stories where people slowly get
to know each other, too. As for what I want to say through my work, well, I
think slow and steady is just the best! That’s what I have to say.
This work underwent some revisions in the time between it first being
published online to when it was made into a book, but honestly, Amane and
Mahiru aren’t quite focused directly on each other yet. The real fun begins
in Volume 2.
I’m still going to take things slow and steady as the series continues, but
I plan for them both to take steps toward the other. Both characters having
unrequited love is the best!

I gave our heroine Mahiru her nickname of angel, but it was the illustrations
that really made her live up to that nickname. My thanks to Hazano
Kazutake. You really made Mahiru, aka the school angel, even more


charming.
Actually, when I met with the head editor, I happened to put forth the
idea that Kazutake would be good for the illustrations. Imagine my surprise
when I heard the offer had been accepted!
I was so excited to work with a master whose drawings I’d admired for
so long. Thank you so much for taking charge of the illustrations!
You can tell from looking at Kazutake’s incredibly charming
illustrations, but every character in this book is cute. Reviewing the final
drawings was almost too much for me. The angel actually looks heavenly.
I am just brimming with gratitude for your incredible work!

Well then, we’ve come to the end, but I still need to express my gratitude to
everyone who’s helped me along the way.
To the lead editor, who put so much effort into getting this book
published, to everyone in the GA Books editorial section, to everyone in the
sales department, to the proofreaders, to Hazano Kazutake, to everyone at
the printing office, and to all of you who’ve picked up this book, I extend
my humblest gratitude.
As I lay down my pen, it is my sincerest wish that we will all meet again
in the next volume.

Thank you so much for reading all the way to the end!


“Ah!”
Amane let out a panicked yelp as he was suddenly plunged into
darkness.
The weather had been calling for storms all week due to an unusual
pressure front, and indeed, the sounds of thunder and heavy rain outside
were unceasing. But Amane hadn’t expected it to get bad enough to knock
out the power.
After an especially loud crack of thunder, the lights went out all at once,
from the bulbs to the television. It was a total blackout.
Luckily, his computer had been unplugged, so it likely hadn’t suffered
any damage, but he would have to check the other appliances later.
“Do you have your phone? I left mine in a backpack in my bedroom.”
He wished he had a flashlight handy, but a phone would have to do.
Unfortunately, Amane had left his in his room, but he figured Mahiru would
have hers. She had been sitting next to him, working on problems in a
textbook, when the lights cut out.
However, there was no reply.
“...Mahiru?” he called out anxiously.
Amane thought he felt something tugging on his sleeve. He asked what
happened, and still, there was no answer. He blindly extended a hand
toward where Mahiru had been sitting, and brushed up against something
slender that he assumed was Mahiru’s arm... It was easy to tell that she was
trembling as she started and pulled away.


There was a loud _thud_ as something fell down, and then a groan. He
heard a grumbling voice come from the floor.
“What a disgrace...”
“...Um, sorry I startled you.”
“...No. I startled myself; that’s all.”
Mahiru didn’t seem particularly bothered by her fall from the sofa as she
groped around and found her original position.
Amane was worried that she had landed hard on something, but she
didn’t seem to be in pain or anything. Then, perhaps while Mahiru searched
for the hem of Amane’s shirt again, her fingertips brushed against him
lightly.
It tickled, and without thinking, he grabbed her slim wrist, and she
started trembling again. This time, she didn’t fall off the sofa.
“Looking for something?”
“...Are you being sarcastic?”
“Why in the world would I be?”
“I thought you would make fun of me for getting so shaken up by a little
blackout...”
“I’m not that much of an ass.”
Usually, Mahiru was very levelheaded and not the kind to scare easily—
but she was still a teenager, and even an adult could feel anxious if the
power suddenly went out.
Outside, the thunder rolled on, accompanying the endless drumming of
raindrops, but inside the apartment, it was quiet and still. Mahiru continued
fiddling nervously with the hem of Amane’s shirt, but she didn’t make any
moves to brush off his hand. He had been a little nervous about touching
her at first, but now he gently squeezed her hand.
“...So I guess you’re not a big fan of the dark?”
He spoke to her softly and could more or less make out that she shook
her head.
“...I don’t hate it, but...”
“Mm-hmm?”
“...I just don’t like it when it’s bright one moment and dark the next—
that’s all.”
“Ah, okay.”
“I’m not really afraid of the dark, and I don’t feel scared.”


“Sure, yeah.”
Mahiru stubbornly dismissed her fears in an even more aloof tone than
usual, but Amane had spent enough time with her to know it was all an
adorable bluff.
He smiled slightly, thinking that the cover of darkness could be a good
thing, but Mahiru added in a small voice, “...There’s just one thing.”
He stopped smiling and leaned slightly toward Mahiru. “Hmm?”
“...When we sit like this, I know I’m not alone, and I feel better,”
Mahiru mumbled. She sounded relieved.
“I see,” said Amane, and he gently squeezed her hand again.

“...The power’s back on. I’m going to check my appliances.”
The moment the lights in the room flashed to life, Mahiru gently slipped
out of Amane’s hold and stood up.
Amane smiled wryly at her transparent change in attitude, but he noticed
that the ears poking out from under her flaxen hair were red and decided to
not say anything.
He stood up, too, to go look at the circuit breaker and check that nothing
had malfunctioned. When he passed Mahiru, he heard a small “Thank you”
and couldn’t help but stare at her.
In a fluster, Mahiru turned away quickly and went to the kitchen to
escape. Amane simply scratched his cheek and headed for the washroom to
check on the breakers there.
Once inside, he noticed that his reflection in the mirror had slightly
flushed cheeks. “That’s weird,” he muttered as he turned away bashfully.
